MATH PRACTICE

  A Handy Math Drill Package for Your Use

  by Geoff Wells

Probably the first program of any consequence that most of us write is
some sort of math quiz.  Unfortunately, the beginner is so concerned
with just getting the program to run that little attention is given to
formatting.  Having the output of the program scroll from the bottom
to the top of the screen is not very interesting.

In this version of a math test, there is an opening title and input of
the playerâ€™s name.  You are then given a choice of problems: addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division or a mixture of each.  By using
INKEY$ in a printing loop, the letters A, S, D, M and X will flash
until you press the appropriate key.

Your choice of problems will then be printed inside randomly colored
blocks which will clear if answered correctly.  You have two chances
to get each question right before the correct answer is displayed and
you are directed to the next problem.

After you have completed all ten questions, your score and time are
displayed, along with a comment on your performance.  If you are
running the program for children, you may wish to edit some of the
responses to a less caustic message.
