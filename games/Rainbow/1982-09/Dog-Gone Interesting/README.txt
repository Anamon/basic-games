DOG-GONE INTERESTING

  This is a Dog-Gone Interesting Program

Readers of the June and August issues of the RAINBOW will recall an
article on various printers and a somewhat heated (if tongue-in-cheek)
reply by Dave Hooper of Hoffman Estates, Ill.

In his letter, Mr. Hooper referred to a program written by James
H. Barringer of Taylor, Mich., which reproduced a figure of a famous
canine through the Line Printer VII.  Our editorial note attached to
the letter was that we wished we could have been able to run the
screen print Mr. Hooper furnished, but were advised not to do so due
to possible copyright violations.

In the meantime, Mr. Barringer has been kind enough to furnish us with
a copy of the program, which he has placed in public domain.  While we
still cannot run the screen print, the program listed below should
give you an idea of what the Line Printer VII can do.  You must, of
course, load in a graphic screen print program (available from Custom
Software Engineering, 807 Minuteman Causeway. Cocoa Beach, FL 32931 or
from a Radio Shack store) to get the actual printout.  Custom Software
Engineering also has programs which will work with the Epson MX-80 as
well as both LI and 1.0 ROM 80C's.  The Line Printer VIII will work,
too.

Thanks to Mr. Hooper and Mr. Barringer for this program.
