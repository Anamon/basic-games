PUT AND GET DEMO

PUT, GET and Random Forms Make for Unusual Graphics 

The following program is another of those "pretty" graphics creations
which, if you will study it, shows some very interesting ways to
handle PUT, GET and random graphics.

There are several different types of shapes which can be repeated on
the screen with this program, with colors, backgrounds, and increments
of the shapes chosen randomly.  But the main feature is the drawing of
the figures at an "angle" in the background and then PUTting it in the
middle of the screen straight up and down.

We believe this is one you will like if you are into graphic
demonstrations in any way.
