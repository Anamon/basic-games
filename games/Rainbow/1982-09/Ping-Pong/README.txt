PING-PONG

  Ping-Pong International Game for People and 80C 

  by Wolfgang Hryzak 

Ping-Pong has been a game of international interest for a number of
years, so I thought I would submit a Ping-Pong game to the RAINBOW to
share this international spirit with the Color Computer.

The game, while in BASIC and a bit slow, is a variation of the PONG
game which has been so popular.  It requires two players, each with
their own joystick and they can move their paddles up and down in this
way.

The "ball" bounces off the paddles, of course, but also bounces off
the "walls" of the screen.  As in the original arcade game, if it hits
in a corner, you may have to do quite a bit of angle-judging.

Those with Color Computers which cannot accept the "Speedup Poke"
should remove it in Line 70.  If your computer can accept this, then
the game will run a little faster.

For those who do not know the German language, a few notes will
probably be helpful.  (Editor’s Note: We have left the instructions in
German to retain the game’s flavor.)

In Line 50, "SCHWIERIGKEITSGRAD" means "LEVEL" in English; in Line 60
"ERSTER" means "FIRST" and "ZWEITER" means "SECOND," "SPIELER"
translates to "PLAYER."

The word "ERGEBNISLISTE" in Line 340 translates "LIST OF PLAYS" while
"SPIEL" means "GAME."  Line 370's instruction "JPYSTK TAUSCHEN" is
"EXCHANGE THE JOYSTICK" and, finally, Line 390's "HAT GEWONNEN" means
"HAS WON."

The 80C is beginning to make some inroads into the Austrian and
European market after a slow start and I look forward to continuing to
read about its progress in the RAINBOW.
