SUB HUNT

  Rise Through the Ranks with Sub Hunt
  by Carl Shell

"Two points abaft the starboard beam, mates! She steams at forty
fathoms! All hands on deck."  Bleeep... bleeep... bleeep...

Sub Hunt is a very easy game to learn, but hard enough to master so
you won't get bored.  I loaded it into a CoCo at a local Radio Shack
store a few weeks ago, and the kids were still playing it several
hours later when I returned.  (Kids?  The store manager was right in
there with them!)

Instructions are included in the program and move you readily into
action.  You are the captain of a roving Destroyer, firing depth
charges at the enemy submarine fleet in the murky waters beneath your
hull.  There are 10 subs to a fleet and each one is worth 10 points.
If you wipe out an entire fleet, you receive an additional 50 points,
and another fleet of 10 subs appears on the screen.

You have 500 units of time to rack up points, which you use to climb
in rank to Fleet Commander, to Admiral of the Navy and all the way to
Commander in Chief.

While playing Sub Hunt, you only have three keys to use to accomplish
all the action: the "F" key fires the depth charges, the "G" key moves
your Destroyer to the left, and the "H" key moves it to the right.

I hope you enjoy the sound effects and color I've put into the
program; some of my friends who own other computers can't believe the
CoCo can create the sounds it does in BASIC.
