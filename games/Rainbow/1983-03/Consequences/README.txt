CONSEQUENCES

  A Disjointed Tale for Assorted Wags 
  by T. & R. Delbourgo

Remember that old party game some of us called "Consequences?"  Each
of a number (greater than two) of people, seated round a table is
provided with a slip of paper on which s/he must write a short story;
for example:

  (1) Napoleon met (2) Josephine on (3) the Isle of Elba.
  (4) It was a desolate scene.
  (5) He said: It is lonely here.
  (6) She said: Donâ€™t despair!
  (7) The consequence was: He returned to the mainland.
  (8) The moral is: Never say die.

However, the whole point of the game is that at every stage of the
story the papers are passed round the table.  The result can be a
hilarious jumble of stories with the oddest characters and
consequences!

Your CoCo can add to the fun of the proceedings by offering a whole
new series of permutations that are just not possible in the pencil
and paper version.  To give a little spice, the computer can assign a
color code to every player (up to eight) and throw in some sound
effects for good measure.  The following program is self-explanatory
and we think it can be used to liven up a party when spirits are
starling to flag.

Type in the listing below exactly as it appears (spaces, etc.)  to
achieve a perfect layout.  In Line 16, as each tale is presented, you
have the option of being able to print out any story which has
particular appeal.  Even though we have reserved 4500 characters in
string space (Line 4), try to keep your sentences fairly short, say
one line at most.
