OPTICAL ILLUSIONS

  by D. and R. Delbourgo 

The eye is easily deceived.  Psychologists will tell you that our
perception of shape is noticeably influenced by the geometry and
character of the surroundings: nowhere is this more apparent than in
the most famous optical illusions.  The listing below contains a
number of such illusions (except for the checkered spirals and endless
stairs) for your amusement.  The CoCo can score over the textbook
demonstrations in that the shapes can be presented alternately, with
and without perturbation from the surrounds.  Because highest
resolution is essential, this means that all graphics pages are used
up, and unfortunately, this leaves little room for the program itself.

In spite of severe compression we have been incapable of squeezing all
the material into 16K, but 32K is well and truly ample.  Therefore,
for those of you with 16K machines, we suggest that you delete lines
47-70, 80-82, and lines 10, 18-22 from the total listing and call this
your first program.  Then (from the whole listing again) delete lines
13-17. 24-46 and 3-7, 76-79 and call this your second program.

See how well your eyes stand up to the tests and experiment with the
programs by shifting and distorting the basic shapes relative to their
settings -- another piece of flexibility that comes by courtesy of the
TRS-80C.
