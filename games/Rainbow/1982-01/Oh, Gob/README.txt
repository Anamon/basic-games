OH, GOB!

Get That Gobbler!

From those wonderful people at Illustrated Memory Banks who brought
you so much fun with ZELDA'S BAT BOTTLE lust a short month ago now
comes... OH, GOB!

If you're sick and tired of leftover turkey by this time of the year,
here's a chance to help out a friendly turkey and yourself.

OH, GOB! lets you help the turkey by moving it through a field while a
bunch of pilgrims shoot at it.  Use your joystick.  Every time the
turkey makes it safe, you score a turkey. If the turkey gets shot, the
pilgrims score a hat.  You have to save five turkeys before the top of
the screen is filled with pilgrim hats to win.

As with ZELDA, we hope you'll pÂ»y attention to the fine BASIC graphics
by Fred Scerbo of IMB (P.O. Box 289, Williamstown, MA 01267).

Two notes: Some Color Computers have trouble using the CPU speedup
routine (RAINBOW Vol. 1, No. 1) which is contained here in Line 630.
If yours is one of them, merely edit Line 10 to delete the GOSUB630
and delete Line 630.  If the speedup works O.K., you will want to type
POKE 65494,0 in command mode before saving the program to tape.
Because of the speedup, type in the whole program before running it.

If the odds are too tough for you, then you can affect them by an edit
to Line 280.

Have a good time with the gobblers!
