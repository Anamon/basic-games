OUTPOST FIVE

  Stayin' Alive at Outpost Five

By Dr. Laurence D. Preble 



What do you do on a frosty winter's evening?  Well, assuming the wife
isn't nearby for some quiet time by the fireside, I like to write
programs.  Is that so strange?

A 1981 winter's-eve programming effort consisted of my first attempt
at learning Extended Color Basic.  With all those neat graphics to try
out, I couldn't help myself; a game program was inevitable.

Imagine yourself the field commander of five Federation outposts.  The
outposts rest in synchronous orbit above planet four in the Omega
system.  Fifteen marauding aliens in saucer ships bombard your
outposts kamikaze style.

From your remote station, you control the fire power of the outposts.
Your battle computer gives you the simulated view of the attack.  You
use your joystick to position the cross hairs over the attacking
saucer.  The button is pressed.  Blam!  You missed.  The alien has
deviously engaged a semi-random flight path.  BOOM!  The outpost on
your screen is annihilated in a ball of expanding energy.  This is not
going to be easy!  The view screen switches.  Only four outposts left.
Another alien plots a zig-zag course.  You fire.  Missed!  This time
you use the smart bomb!  Your hand flashes to the keyboard of your
terminal.  You're not sure which key was pressed but it doesn't
matter.  Your only smart bomb for this outpost has done its job.  The
saucer disappears in clouds of expanding vapor.

Don't rest yet.  Another wave is coming!
