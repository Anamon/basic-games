MARQUEE DE FIN

Ever get to the end of a tough adventure game, with your heart
pounding with pride from finally winning, and your ears flapping
violently under your hat, only to receive nothing more for your
valiant effort than a green screen with the tiny words "Want to play
again? Y/N"?

Well, from Morton Goldberg of Newtown, MA, here’s some medicine for
that malady, a way to go out in style when the "end" comes.  If you’re
a beginner, remember that the program lines beginning with REM are
just comment lines, or REMarks, about what that section of the program
does; you need not type these lines in for the program to work.  The
REM statements will help you if you want to modify the program to your
own needs.  Or, just use Marquee as is and tack it on the end of one
of your programs.
