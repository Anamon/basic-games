  AHHA!  Another Haunted House Adventure!
  by Geoff Wells

In this third and final installment of the general all purpose
adventure driver (GAPAD) program, we present the changes and additions
necessary to run yet another haunted house adventure.  This is the
complete program for AHHA, so those of you who have already typed in
GAPAD need only make a few changes and add some of the data.

The mysterious old miser has been dead for many years, but the
fortune, said to be hidden somewhere in his old mansion, has yet to be
found.  Many people have entered the mansion to search for the
treasure, but none has ever returned.  There are stories of the old
manâ€™s ghost being too mean to leave the money behind, and strange
cries of anguish have been heard from those who have tried to steal
it.
