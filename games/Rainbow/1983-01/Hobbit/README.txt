HOBBIT

  Running from Orcs Can Be "Hobbit-Forming"

  by David Sweet

If you were a Hobbit, wandering through the woods on an important
Hobbit errand, and suddenly found yourself surrounded by (shudder)
dreaded ores, what in middle-earth would you do?

Since you have in your possession the magical CoCo (a gift from
Gandolf, perhaps?) you need only to strike the "N" key to be whisked
to safety -- at least for the moment.  But you need to be careful, for
stroking the "N-Amulet" only works once!

The object of this engaging game is for the "Hobbit" (the player) to
escape from the orcs, which resemble a popular arcade-game character.

After typing RUN the player will be asked how many orcs he thinks he
can escape from.  Pick five this time and hit ENTER.  The screen will
then be cleared and five orcs, quite a few trees, and a pair of
flashing eyes (thatâ€™s the Hobbit) will appear.  If you are in a bad
position (surrounded by four orcs, or cornered) you may hit "N" and
receive a new screen.  As we said, you may only do this once, and
after you have moved you cannot use this option at all.  To eliminate
the ores, you must guide them into the trees.  Orcs are not very
intelligent!

Movement is like this:

     1  2  3
      \ | /
    4 <-5-> 6 
      / | \
     7  8  9

For example: typing a "2" will move you one position up and a "9" will
move you one position right and one down.

A "5" cannot be typed twice in a row.  Once you move by typing the
appropriate number, the orcs will begin moving.  This will continue
until all the orcs are eliminated or you are caught!

The game includes a three-round scoring system which is
self-explanatory.
