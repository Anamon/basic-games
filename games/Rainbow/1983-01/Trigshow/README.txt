TRIGSHOW

  A Graphic Look at Basic Trigonometry

  by Carlos Rumbaut

We at the Rainbow are seeing an increasing flow of educational
programming of late, and view this trend with justifiable optimism.

Examples, such as the recent submission listed here, are helping
strengthen the color computer as a respected educational tool.

The program, Trigshow, uses high-resolution graphics and animation to
provide dynamic illustrations of some basic concepts in geometry and
trigonometry.  Although best used as an auxiliary introduction to
these concepts in a study of geometry, it can also be helpful to those
with a limited working knowledge of them.

Instructions throughout the program make it self-explanatory to the
user.  A list of topics is shown on the CRT; selecting one brings up
the sectionâ€™s "title page," where the particular concept is defined.
Following this comes an explanation of the graphics display, followed
by the display itself.  The section ends with a multiple-choice quiz.
Each step or "page" is summoned by the space bar, so the user goes at
his/her own pace.

Trigshow is around 8K long.  Extended Basic and at least 16K RAM is
required.
