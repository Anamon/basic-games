THE GREAT PUMPKIN

  Here's a Halloween Graphic Program for You

  by Dave Hooper

Pumpkins: 
   (A) Smell
   (B) Attract Bugs
   (C) Cause Fires
   (D) All Of The Above

If you answer "D," you were right.  What you win is the program listed
below, which will allow you to display a pumpkin in your window for
Halloween that doesn't smell, attract bugs or cause fires.

Load in this program, put your monitor or TV in the window and run it.
You get an 80C version of a pumpkin for Halloween.

Thanks to the intrepid Dave Hooper for this program.
