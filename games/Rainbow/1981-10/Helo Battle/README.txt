HELO BATTLE

Helicopter Battleground for You

If you enjoyed fighting around the LASER STAR last month, JARB
SOFTWARE offers another sample goodie for your joysticking pleasure
this month as well.

This is HELO BATTLE, which pits you against a fortified castle that
shoots antiaircraft rounds at your helicopter.

To play, you have to fly your chopper to avoid the incoming fire
while, at the same time, aiming and firing your gun.

The right joystick controls the copter's flight and the left the
chopper's gun.  Obviously, there is some eye-hand coordination
necessary here!  At the end of the game, your friendly COLOR Computer
will let you know who won the encounter -- and will give you the
option of playing again.

You can purchase HELO BATTLE on a tape with LASER STAR by sending
$14.95 to JARB SOFTWARE, 1169 Florida St., Imperial Beach, CA, 92032.
Please add $1 for postage and handling.

Oh... watch out for the sneaky little guy!
