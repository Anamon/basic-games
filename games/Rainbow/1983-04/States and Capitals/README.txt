STATES AND CAPITALS

  Pop Quiz: Name the 50 Capitals
  by Chuck Faessler

States and Capitals is a short program which may be helpful with your
children's homework.  It is a question and answer drill to aid in the
learning of all 50 states and capitals.  It also can be easily
modified to be used with other question-answer drills.

After the basic program is loaded with CLOAD, type RUN.  The
instructions are then displayed along with the first question.  If the
answer is correct, another question will be displayed.  The computer
allows you two chances to answer the question correctly; if you are
wrong on both tries, it will display the answer and then repeat the
question.  After completing 10 questions, your score is calculated and
displayed.  At this time you are given the opportunity to continue or
stop.

The states and capitals can be reversed by changing the following:

  Line 80  - SWAP STATES AND CAPITALS
  Line 150 - REPLACE CAPITAL AND A$(I) WITH STATE AND B$(I)
  Line 160 - REPLACE B$(I) WITH A$(I)
  Line 380 - REPLACE B$(I) WITH A$(I)
