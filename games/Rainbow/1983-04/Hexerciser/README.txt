  Everything You Wanted to Know About Hex...
  by Jim Schmidt

One of the more difficult concepts in the world of computers is that
old devil -- Hex!  The fact that most of us were born with only ten
fingers and toes seems to make grasping the concept of another number
base more difficult than it should be.  Over the years it has
sometimes fallen to me to instruct novices in programming on this
subject.  Most professional programmers have their share of trouble
with Hex.

The program I offer here is a BASIC version of one I wrote in COBOL
several years ago.  Basically, it allows the confused to "play" with
Hexadecimal numbers at whatever pace is most comfortable.  Coupled
with independent reading on number bases and Hex in particular, it
lets the concepts involved show themselves through experimentation.
It's about as painless a way as I've ever found to investigate and
learn about Hex.  It can even be fun!

I suggest that in addition to running the "Hexcrciser" that the logic
of the program, and especially the two conversion commands, be
studied.  That, plus additional reading on the subject, should
eliminate any Hex "hex" that may plague you.

For those of you who will be keying this program in, let me first
suggest that you take advantage of the bargain of the century and
subscribe to Rainbow on Tape.  Now, while you're waiting for your
first tape, let me save you a little trouble.  The following lines are
mostly cosmetic and can be ignored:

  Line 40 
  Lines 20000 through the end of the program

Have fun...
