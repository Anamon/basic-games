LIGHTNING

  Here's a Flashy Little Program, By Thunder
  by John Plaxton

The following program, Lightning, continually generates a single flash
of forked lightning across a PMODE4 screen.  Each flash is different.

The program is part of a father-son effort in generating an electronic
window display of numerous scenes suitable for Halloween.

You may be interested in trying to devise a suitable program for
thunder.
