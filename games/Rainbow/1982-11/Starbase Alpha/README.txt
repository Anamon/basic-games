STARBASE ALPHA

  Here is a Way to Protect Your Planet-Bound Bases

  by Jim Ebbert

The following program, Starbase Alpha, is a takeoff on the familiar
theme of planet defense against alien attackers from space.  It is
contributed by Acesoft Software for your enjoyment.

The program is simple to operate and requires some pretty fast work.
Although written in Basic, it is difficult to "get" all the attacking
missiles.

We contribute the program not only for your enjoyment, but in an
effort to sharpen your programming skills as well.  Please note some
of the routines and feel free to use them in the programs you develop.
The end-of-game scoring mechanism is an interesting one which has many
of the features of "initials and scores" found in arcade games.  We
hope you will like Starbase Alpha.
