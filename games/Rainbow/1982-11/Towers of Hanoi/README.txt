TOWERS OF HANOI

  Towers of Hanoi is a Game for You Thinkers 

  by Robert A. Kelley


Towers of Hanoi is a classic puzzle involving the transfer of
progressively larger disks from one peg to another, using a third peg
as a temporary holding place.  Instructions are simple and can be
found in the program listing.

Some of you might be interested in its name.  Towers of Hanoi is
called that because it is believed it was first developed by the
ancient elders of Indochina as a study in logic.  Whatever the source,
it is an interesting game which is fun to play and difficult to solve.

The program was written for 16K but is readily adaptable to a 4K CoCo
using standard condensing techniques (delete REMs, shorten the
variable names, etc.)  There is a neat solution to the problem which
requires the application of a regressive mathematical function, but
the fun comes in discovering the solution during play.
