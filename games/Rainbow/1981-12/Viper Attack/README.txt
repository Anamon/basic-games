VIPER ATTACK

Here Come the Vipers

Here's one we think you'll enjoy.

Dave Hooper submits this program, called VIPER ATTACK, which is, he
admits, a first effort in game programming.  I am sure most of you
will agree that it certainly doesn't appear to be a first effort and
that it is a lot of fun to play.

There are still a few refinements coming for VIPER ATTACK.  When
available, Dave plans to market this program.  Because some of the
special niceties, like on-screen scoring, are not included, you can
type it in and run it, courtesy of Dave and the RAINBOW.

Pay careful attention to the nasties!  There are a number of different
kinds, and we think you'll appreciate the graphic detail with which
Dave has concerned himself.  As he wrote the other day, it can be a
frustrating experience trying to get just what you want.

If you want a tape version (tired fingers?) Dave will be able to
supply same for $9.95 plus $1.50 postage and handling.  The address is
4490 N. Mumford Dr., Hoffman Estates, IL, 60195.
