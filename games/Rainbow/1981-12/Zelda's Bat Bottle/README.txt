ZELDA'S BAT BOTTLE

Zelda and Her Bats

What does a witch need more than anything else?  Other than her
broomstick, its got to be a bat.  And there are a lot of them in this
program from Illustrated Memory Banks.

ZELDA'S BAT BOTTLE is brought to you courtesy of Fred Scerbo of IMB
and we think you'll find it a lot of fun to play.

As most of you undoubtedly know, witches need all kinds of special
things to make their sagic potions.  Bats happen to be one of them
and, in the instant situation, Zelda needs 10 of thee.  You need to
help her zap them, fill up the bottle, and do it as quickly as
possible.  ZELDA'S BAT BOTTLE will tell you how long it takes!

ZELDA'S BAT BOTTLE is copyrighted by Illustrated Memory Banks and may

single end use.  For permission to make additional copies, contact IMB
at P. O. Box 289, Williamstown, MA, 01267.

Incidentally, you might pay special attention to the graphics.  You
will notice they are a little different than those which have been
presented in the RAINBOW in the past but are extremely attractive!  We
think you'll like this one... and will have some fun helping Zelda
out.
