QUIZ

Make Your Kids Like the Quiz Kids

The "QUIZ" program listed below was written by FALSOFT for use in
preparing schoolchildren for tests.  Its primary aim was to make it
easy to enter questions and answers.

One of the main advantages of this program is that it automatically
counts the number of data statements, thus eliminating the need to set
any parameters.  This is primarily true in line 400, which insures
that the student cannot memorize the order of the answers, because the
program selects the questions at random.

It is important to remember that most questions can be asked two ways.
Note line 601: The question there is "Capital of Kentucky?" and the
answer is "Frankfort."  But, in many cases, a teacher might ask the
question "backwards," or ask "What state is Frankfort the capital of?"

You can see how this situation is handled in line 601.  We didn't do
it for every line, simply because we're sure you will have your own
sets of questions and answers.

This does work and is fun for the kids.  In fact, this Program helped
one youngster in Kentucky raise her grade in one course by two letters
in six weeks!  And, typing data statements was a lot easier than
sitting down and drilling the student over and over.  The student also
has the advantage of deciding on a short or a long session, and there
is a test "report card" at the end.  If you want to check your
student, just add PRINT#-2, statements in line 350 and you'll have a
record of how the sessions went.
