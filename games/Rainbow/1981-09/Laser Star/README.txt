can send $14.95 to JARB (1169 Florida St., Imperial Beach, CA, 92032)
for a cassette copy.  Add $1 for postage and you will get this tape,
plus another game, Helo Battle.  Helo Battle will appear in listing

LASER STAR is a two-player game which allows both players to manuever
their respective spacecraft -- a rocket ship and a saucer.  The object
is to destroy your foe enough times to advance in rank and win the
battle.

Its not all that easy, though.  While you are fighting, there is an
alien asteroid control station which fires a powerful laser at space
dust, meteoroids, and asteroids.  If the blast hits you, you lose
points.  Also, if you collide with your opponent, one of you will also
lose points (sort of like no-fault insurance).

There's anothe hitch, too, that can cause you to lose points.  But
we're not going to tell you about it.  Let's just hint that it
paralizes space in in your sector and can be very troublesome.  You'll
see!

The joysticks control movement of the two space ships and the aiming
point of their lasers.  They cannot shoot backwards, though.

We think you will enjoy playing LASER STAR.
