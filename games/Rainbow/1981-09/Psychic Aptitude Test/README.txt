PSYCHIC APTITUDE TEST

Are you psychotic... ur, uh... psychic?

The following program (PAT) is brought to you courtesy of JARB
Sofrware.  It is a Psychic Aptitude Test in format, and is a lot of
fun to see how psychic you might be.

Note that by comparison to QUIZ, the program itself Is pretty short --
from lines 10 to 290, and a great deal of that is instruction.

You should also note that this one is more gee-whiz than is QUIZ.  It
employs the use of sounds and colors to a greater degree than does
QUIZ.  That certainly will make it more appealing to younger
test-takers.

PAT is easily adaptable to other uses, particularly school review.  It
does require that the student go through from start to finish, but
more than makes up for it by the colors and sounds.

For those of you who do not want to type in the program (and then
debug the typos), PAT can be ordered from JARB Software, 1169 Florida
St., Imperial Beach, CA 92032 for $14.93 plus $1 for shipping.  You'll
get a bonus, though, a copy of JARB BIORHYTHM included on the same
tape.  Although JARB chief programmer Joe Bennett promises us a copy
of JARB BIORHYTHM for a future issue of the RAINBOW, its a long
program and he emphasizes the bargain in sending off for the tape.
