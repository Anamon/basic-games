COMPUTERIZED STAR MAP

Stars Fall on 80C

This neat little program from Ray Moses of Moses Engineering Mill give
you a display of the sky using a variety of times of the year.

The program, as it is listed below, explains what inputs have to 16K
be made and how to make them.  Once those inputs are made, STARMAP
Will show you the sky at the time of year that you ask it to.

Some 80Câ€™s may get slightly hung up running this program and will
display a large number of lines when the star map is drawn.  This
usually happens the first time the program is run, but can happen
other times, too.  If it happens to you, just BREAK the program and
RUN it again.  That should clear things up.

There are several options here as to display of the sky in terms of
time of the year and hemisphere.

We hope you enjoy this program.
