WILD, WILD WEB

Watch Out for the Wild, Wild Web

If you don’t like spiders, don’t play WILD, WILD WEB, because in it
you are a spider and your object is to get a good, wholesome lunch.

While there are many differing opinions about what a good, wholesome
lunch might consist of among us humans, there is little debate among
spiders.  They like ants.  (We are told they like moths for dinner.)

This game, brought to you by the IMB dynamic duo of Fred Scerbo and
Dale Haggerty (a.k.a. Snail), will let you sit in your web and try to
get some ants for lunch.  Use the right joystick to direct your little
web and the "fire" button to shoot out a web at the ant.  You're
measured on how long it takes you.

As always, please remember this game is for your personal use and
pleasure and is not to be copied for any other reason.  Similarly, the
routines are for use in the game, but not for use in any software you
write.

Get those ants!
