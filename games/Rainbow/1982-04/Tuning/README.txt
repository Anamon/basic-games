TUNING

Julie's Song...

Julie Kerr, 10, of Bellevue, Wash., is as interested in music as she
is in computers.  So, she wrote the following program as an example of
how CoCo can be used in a musical application.

The program generates a random sound for a couple of seconds, then
starts at another random sound.  You can maneuver the second sound up
or down the scale until you think it matches the first.  The program
will tell you how close you came to a match!

Julie's mother, by the way, says it is only Julie among her family who
consistently gets the "Tuned By An Expert" message.

This program's idea, and the code for it, was Julie's idea and
inspiration.  We hope you like it.
