ALPINE ALIENS

Will the ALPINE ALIENS Win... Or Will You?

Now, let us journey to the Alps of a distant moon and see whether we
will be able to survive an attack by aliens trying to get to our base.

This game, ALPINE ALIENS, is brought to you from Illustrated Memory
Banks.  It pits you, as a defender, against the aliens attacking from
the skies.

We remind you that ALPINE ALIENS is copyrighted by IMB.  You are
allowed to use the game for your own enjoyment, but may neither make
copies for others nor may you use the routines here in any other
programs.

The program is self-prompting in that you need only load and run it to
see the directions.

Will the alien saucer annoy your colonists?  Or can you keep it away?
Here, then, is ALPINE ALIENS for you to decide.
