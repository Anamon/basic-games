JARBIORHYTHM

How's Your Day?  Need Biorhythm Help?

Here's another program from JARB Software that will help you out in
dealing with everyday life.

Its called JARBIORHYTHM and it will generate a complete chart for you.
The chart can be as short as a day, or as long as a year.  And, the
chart will graphically display just how your biorhythms fluctuate over
their different cycles.

You do need a printer for this program.  But it comes out with a
handsome display.  We've heard that programs such as this can be a big
hit at flea markets!

For those of you with tired fingers, JARBIORHYTHM can be obtained on a
tape with PSYCHIC APTITUDE TEST (from RAINBOW Vol. I, No. 3) for
$14.95 by writing JARB at 1169 Florida St., Imperial Beach, CA 92032.
Please include $1 for postage and handling.
