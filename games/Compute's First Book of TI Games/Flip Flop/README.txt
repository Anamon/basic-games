FLIP FLOP

  by C. Regena 

  Planning and thought make "Flip Flop" a game that people have
  enjoyed for years.

"Flip Flop" is a board game is which you alternate plays with the
computer.  To make a legal move, you must sandwich in at least one
square of the opposite color between your new move and any previous
square of your color.  You thus capture any colored squares between
your two squares, and the captured squares are changed to your color
-- the colors are reversed.  You may capture horizontally, vertically
or diagonally, or in several directions at once.  If a legal move
cannot be made, it is the other player's turn.

Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to your desired position, then
press ENTER.  If it is a legal move, your marker will replace the
cursor, and the appropriate squares will be reversed.

The game is over when the board is filled, when one player has all the
squares on the board, or when it is impossible for either player to
move.  The player with the most squares is the winner.
