WORDSEARCH

  by C. Regena

  Since you enter your own words, this game is suitable for both
  beginning readers and those who have enjoyed puzzles for years.

This program creates a "Wordsearch" puzzle like those found in
magazines and books.  You may enter up to 20 words.  The words are
placed in the puzzle horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  Random
letters fill the remaining spaces, then the puzzle is printed.  Your
object is to find the hidden words.
