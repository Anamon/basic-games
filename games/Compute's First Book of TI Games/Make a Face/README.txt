MAKE A FACE

  by C. Regena

  This simple program helps teach young children how to make menu
  selections while allowing them to be creative.

Veiy few computer programs allow young children to be creative.  Most
programs tell children what to do.  Sure, they are given the options
usually present in computer games and programs, but rarely are they
allowed to be truly creative.

Enter "Make a Face."  The TI wiU act as a face-maker.  A child may
choose from several options by pressing a number.  What kind of
choices?  A nose, a mouth, eyes, and eyebrows.

At the end, the child has a face he or she has created.  If the child
wishes to create another face, he or she just presses Y when asked.
