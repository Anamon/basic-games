ROCKET DUEL

  by C. Regena

  This challenging two-player game requires the TI Extended BASIC
  command module.

This Extended BASIC game is designed for two players.  The player at
the left controls the red rocket with the standard arrow keys on E, S,
D, X, and shoots with the F key.  The player at the right controls the
blue rocket with the I, J, K, M keys and shoots with the H key.  Each
player must shoot the other player's rocket without getting hit and
without colliding.
