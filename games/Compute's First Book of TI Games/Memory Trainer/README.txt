MEMORY TRAINER

  This program might help you improve your memory skills.  Some
  people, training in a similar fashion, have been able to quickly
  memorize random 80-digit numbers.

A provocative article, entitled "Exceptional Memory", appeared
recently in American Scientist (vol. 70, no. 6, p. 607, 1982).  The
authors described experiments in which a person with a normal memory
was trained to recall a sequence of over 80 random digits.  How?

When most people read a random sequence once, they can remember only
five to nine digits, the apparent limit of short-term memory (STM).

One might call this prodigious feat of memory (recalling 80 digits)
exceptional, but the authors said that this skill may not be uncommon.
Diligent practice, in one case 230 hours over 20 months, resulted in
improvement in the ability to rapidly transfer information into
long-term memory (LTM).  A "normal" memory could thereby be
transformed into an "exceptional" one.

After reading the article, I realized how easy it would be to
computerize the memory-training task.  Before long, I had written
"Memory Trainer."

Random digits are flashed on the screen at a specified rate, rather
than being read to the subject.  If the sequence is repeated
correctly, the next sequence of digits is increased by one.  When an
error is made, the length of the sequence decreases by one.  The
subject can stop the experiment at any point, whereupon the maximum
number length achieved is displayed.
