DEVASTATOR

  "Devastator" is an arcade-style game which exhibits the sprite
  features of the TI.  The screen is given a 3-D effect by careful use
  of the foreground and background colors.  TI Extended BASIC
  required.

"Devastator" is written in Extended BASIC and requires a joystick.
Your mission in this fast and exciting game is to prevent the
Devastator's craft from destroying Earth.

As the game begins, you find yourself cruising above the ominous
Devastator.  A guardian ship from the Devastator appears.  You must
eliminate this alien ship and at least nine others that follow in a
given period.  If you fail the Devastator blasts Earth with a lethal
laser.

Two levels of difficulty are offered.  On either level you can
eliminate the guardian ship by simply positioning your cross hairs
over them using the joystick.  The main difference between skill
levels lies in the size of these guardian ships (which are actually
sprites).

The CALL MAGNIFY statement in line 420 produces ships of two sizes.
Consequently, on level one, guardian ships are large and can be easily
destroyed, while level two features smaller ships which require
greater dexterity to eliminate.
