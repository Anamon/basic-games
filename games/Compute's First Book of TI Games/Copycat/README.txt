  "Copycat" is an entertaining, musical and colorful "match-me" game.
  It exercises pattern recognition, short-term memory and hand-eye
  coordination, making it an excellent game for all ages,

"Copycat" is a memory game.  The computer plays one of four tones, and
you match the tone by pressing the correct number, 1, 2, 3, or 4.  The
computer then plays two tones.  You match the series by pressing two
numbers in the correct order.  Each round adds one more random tone,
and you need to remember the series to copy.  How long can you be a
copycat?
