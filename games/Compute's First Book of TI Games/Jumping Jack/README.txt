JUMPING JACK

  "Jumping Jack" demonstrates how sound can add excitement to a game.

Jack is running across platforms and climbing down ladders to get to
the bottom of the screen.  Sounds easy enough, right?

There's just one problem: these platforms are not very sturdy at all,
and at any time they can collapse in certain places.  You must be
ready to press the space bar causing Jack to jump.  If your timing is
right. Jack will clear the hole and land safely on his feet.  If not.
Jack will fall into the collapsed section of the platform.

If you are not quick enough on the space bar, you still have a chance
to clear the hole.  Here's how: if the space bar is pressed
immediately after Jack gets over the hole, you can make a saving jump.
However, Jack must be over the hole while in the air to get points for
jumping it, so no points are scored for using a saving jump to get
over a hole,

A saving jump can also be used to jump two holes in a row Simply make
a saving jump as described above for the first hole, and Jack will fly
over the second hole.  This scores points only for the second hole,
however.

If you guide Jack safely to the bottom of the screen, he must begin
again at the top of a new screen with the ladders in different
locations.  As Jack goes through more screens, the platforms become
less and less stable, so he'll have more holes to jump over.
