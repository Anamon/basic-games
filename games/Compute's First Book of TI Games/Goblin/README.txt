GOBLIN

  by Dan Goff 
  Translated for the TI by Patrick Parrish

  Custom characters are used to create a simple entertaining game.
  The object is to capture the creatures zvith your goblin while
  avoiding the block-shaped obstacles that lie in your path.

Sad faces are positioned randomly among barriers on the screen.  You
need to capture the faces by landing on them.  Use the left and right
arrow keys to move your goblin.  If you do not press a key you will
move straight upward.  You will always be moving upward.  When you
reach the top of the screen, you wrap to the bottom of the screen.
Try to clear the screen of all the faces.  Notice that as you are
capturing faces they frown at you, but if your goblin bumps into a
barrier they all laugh with glee.

A running score is printed at the top left of the screen.  The high
score for previous games is printed as HS at the top center of the
screen.
