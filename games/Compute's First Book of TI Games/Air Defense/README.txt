AIR DEFENSE

  by T. L. Wahl
  Translated for the TI by Patrick Parrish

  Play "Air Defense" and try to prevent the bombing of your city.

The object of "Air Defense" is to defend your city at the bottom of
the screen from falling bombs.  The bombs appear at various places at
the top of the screen.  As a bomb falls, line up the cross hairs of
your gunsight with the bomb by using the arrow keys, then fire by
pressing the space bar.  If you prefer, you may use joysticks.  You
get only one shot, and timing is critical.  The sooner you deactivate
the bomb, the higher your score will be.  After 20 bombs you will be
shown your score with the number of hits and the number of misses.
