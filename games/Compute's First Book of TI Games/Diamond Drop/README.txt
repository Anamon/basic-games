DIAMOND DROP

  by Matt Giwer
  Translated for the TI by Patrick Parrish

  Relying on the outstanding sprite capability of TI Extended BASIC,
  "Diamond Drop" offers a game with quick, smooth action.

A series of vertically positioned paddles help you catch colorful
diamonds raining from the top of the screen in "Diamond Drop".  These
paddles can be controUed with the keyboard or with joystick 1 . With
keyboard control, the S and D keys are presently used for left and
right movement.  If you are more comfortable using some other keys,
however, simply substitute the ASCII values corresponding to the
desired keys in lines 420 and 430 for the numbers 68 and 83.  (To find
the ASCII value of a key, use PRINT ASC("X"), where X is the key you
want to use.)
