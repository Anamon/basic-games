BOGGLER

  by Gary Braun
  Translated for the TI by Charles Brannon

  In the tradition of popular board games like checkers, "Boggler"
  should offer hours of intriguing strategic planning as you try to
  capture your opponent's pieces and avoid capture yourself.

This is a simple, yet challenging, game of skill.  The object of the
game is to capture five pairs of your opponent's pebbles or get five
consecutive pebbles in a row, either vertically horizontally or
diagonally.  In this version, the computer acts as the playing board,
checking all moves for validity and keeping score for the two opposing
players, who alternate turns.

At the bottom of the screen is a line that turns either red or blue to
indicate whose turn it is.  The computer drops the first pebble for
red by placing it at the center of the board.  The arrow keys are used
to position the player's pebble in the desired location, and the ENTER
key is used to drop the pebble.

The program then checks to see if the player has captured a pair of
his opponent's pebbles by placing one of his on either side, or if he
has five pebbles in a row.  If the player has captured two pebbles,
the program places them on his side of the board.

Two final notes on the program: it is not possible to move off the
game board; and, as you take a new turn, the program will always
return you to where you made your last play.
