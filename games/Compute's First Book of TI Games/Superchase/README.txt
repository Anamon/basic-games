SUPERCHASE

  This chase game involves more than just staying ahead of the enemy.
  Good strategy can increase your score and prevent capture.

"Superchase" is an arcade-style game in which you try to find all the
treasures before the enemy catches you.  Sounds easy, doesn't it?
Well, it isn't quite that simple.

Using the arrow keys to move left, right up, or down in the maze, stay
on the yellow path and try to pick up as many treasures (purple) as
you can before the enemy chaser gets you.  You leave a white trail, so
the chaser knows where to go.  Since the chaser will follow your exact
trail, you can probably mix him up at the intersections and dead ends.
After you pick up 45 treasures on a screen, the screen clears for a
new maze and more treasures.
