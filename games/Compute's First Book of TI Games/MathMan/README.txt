  Here's proof that computer-aided math practice need not be boring.

"MathMan" is a multiplication drill program for children of elementary
school age.  Type in the answer to the random multiplication problem
shown.  If the answer is correct, the friends gathered will cheer.  If
the answer is incorrect, the correct answer is shown, but one of the
friends will leave.  When all six friends have gone, the game is over.

You may advance to the next level by answering ten problems correctly.
The problems get successively more difficult, and the score for each
problem also increases with each level.
