TRAPSHOOT

  by C. Regena

  Besides being a fast-action shoot game, "Trapshoot" is an excellent
  example of how to use sprites in your own programs.  TI Extended
  BASIC module required.

It's time to try your skill at the TI trapshooting range.  Each game
consists of 50 day pigeons sprung from the trap near the center of the
screen.  You aim the shotgun located at the bottom center of the
screen by pressing the left or right arrow key.  Fire when you are
ready by pressing the ENTER key.  You'll need to aim and fire quickly
-- you have only one chance per target.

At the lower-right side of the screen is your scoring record.  The
number of successful hits, the number of clay pigeons, and the number
of rounds fired are displayed.
