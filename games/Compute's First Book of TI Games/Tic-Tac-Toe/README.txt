TIC-TAC-TOE

  by C. Regena

  This classic game pits player against computer.  On the professional
  level the computer can be a very formidable opponent.

Playing Tic-Tac-Toe 

First choose whether you wish to play at an amateur level or at a
professional level.  Next choose either the X markers or the O
markers.  The X markers have the first move, and you take turns with
the computer.  Try to get three markers in a row -- across, down, or
diagonally -- and at the same time prevent the computer from putting
three markers in a row.
