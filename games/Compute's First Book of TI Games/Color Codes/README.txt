COLOR CODES

Will you break the computer's code?  Can you find the secret sequence?
The computer will give you nine tries and even a few clues to help.

The computer will choose a series of four colors.  Each position may
be one of six colors.  You try to guess the computer's color codes by
pressing the color numbers:

    1  White        4  Blue
    2  Green        5  Purple
    3  Yellow       6  Red

If you make a mistake before you press the fourth color number, press
(zero) to erase your entire guess and start over.

The computer will check your guess.  You will get one black marker for
each correct color that is also in the correct position.  You will get
a white marker for a color that is in the series but not in the
correct position.  The black and white markers are not in any
particular order -- you may not know which color goes with which
marker.  Try to guess the color codes in as few tries as possible.
After your nine guesses, the computer will show you the correct
answer.
