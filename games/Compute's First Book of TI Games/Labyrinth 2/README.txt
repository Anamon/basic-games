LABYRINTH 2

  by C. Regena 

  "Labyrinth 2" uses the split-keyboard technique to create a
  head-to-head game.

"Labyrinth 2" is like the previous game except it is a game for two
players, who are lost at opposite ends of the labyrinth.  The first
one to reach the opposite side of the labyrinth wins. Once the
labyrinth is printed, the option to change the maze is offered in case
there is an "impossible" maze where a player is blocked in.  The
player on the left moves by pressing the regular arrow keys on keys E,
S, D, and X, and the player on the right moves by pressing the I, J,
K, and M keys.
