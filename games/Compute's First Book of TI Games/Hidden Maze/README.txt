HIDDEN MAZE

The maze is there -- you just can't see it!  This maze game adds a new
twist to maze puzzles.

Mazes present a challenge different from arcade-type "shoot-out"
games, but the appeal of a maze can quickly fade once it has been
solved.  I have enhanced its challenge by hiding the complete maze
from the player and showing only a realistically limited view from any
position inside it.  Although the view is from above rather than
ground level, the player still gets a claustrophobic feeling similar
to that of actually being inside the maze and groping along the
corridors.

Playing Hidden Maze

"Hidden Maze" uses the method developed by Charles Bond (see "Maze
Generator" in Chapter 1) to draw a maze on the screen -- only the maze
is hidden.  It takes about two minutes to generate the maze.  If you
watch the blinking square you might get a hint of where the path of
the maze is.  You will then be shown a starting position with a
limited view of the maze.  Use the arrow keys to move -- only a short
distance of the maze will illuminate with each move.  The objective is
to get to the upper-left comer of the rectangle as quickly as
possible.
