ACROSS

  by C. Regena

  The challenging game "Across" is another example of haw scrolling
  can be used in games.

The obstacles are in place.  The course is ready.  Are you?

Your goal in "Across" is to run successfully from one end of the
obstacle course to the other.  Moving from left to right across the
screen, you try to avoid running into any barriers.

If you press any key, you will move to the right one spot and dovm one
spot.  You cannot back up.  If you do not press a key you will
continue downward.
