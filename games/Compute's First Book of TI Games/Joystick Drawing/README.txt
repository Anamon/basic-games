JOYSTICK DRAWING

  by C. Regena

  This simple drawing game shows how to program for both joystick and
  keyboard input.

You may use either the standard arrow keys or joystick number 1 to
make a design.  Move the joystick or press an arrow key to draw in the
desired direction.  To change colors, press the fire button or the Q
key.  One of the colors is the background color or a blank.  If you
get lost, simply press the fire button or Q key to see where you are.
