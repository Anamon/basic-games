Astrostorm

  Try to guide your spaceship, carrying emergency medical supplies,
  through a dangerous asteroid storm.  A great deal depends on your
  skill as a navigator.  The success or failure of your mission will
  often depend on your ability to make split-second decisions under
  pressure.

The mission: You are Captain Bosdiger of the interstellar tug The
Viccard.  While orbiting the fifth planet in the Benard system, you
receive a distress call.  The call comes from the Solarian system, in
need of vital medical supplies.  You are to pick them up from the
sixth planet in the Benard system and then take them to the third
planet in the Solarian system.

There is a time factor: the drugs have a short life.  Your
calculations indicate that it will be necessary to drop out of
hyperspace between the fourth and fifth planets' orbits.  There you
will be in an asteroid field, which you must cross as quickly as
possible.
