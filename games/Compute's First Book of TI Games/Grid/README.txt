GRID

  by C. Regena

  Can you find the lost treasure?  Play "Grid" and find out where in
  the city the treasure is.  This game will also help you in creating
  your own guessing games.

The treasure is lost in a city where the streets are long and
numerous.  As with many old dties, the streets run north-south and
east-west, forming a grid.  Your goal is to find the lost treasure.
Each time you move, the computer gives you a due where to walk.

When the game starts, the computer prints the city streets (a grid) on
the screen.  The computer has hidden the treasure somewhere in the
city.  By using the arrow keys to position yourself (represented by
the little yellow marker), move around the dty until you believe you
are closer to the treasure, then press ENTER.  The computer gives you
a clue: an arrow is printed to show you in which direction to walk.
Try to find the treasure in as few guesses as possible.
