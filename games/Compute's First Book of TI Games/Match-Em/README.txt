Basic, which allows fewer characters to be redefined.]

MATCH-EM

  by C. Regena

  In addition to its primary purpose of captivating youngsters, this
  program also serves as a guide and example of how to create
  educational games on any subject.

This simple matching game is designed for young children.  A screen of
16 squares is shown.  Press the letters on two of the squares to try
to match the shapes.  If you "match-em" the shape will be drawn at the
right side of the screen, and you won't be able to use those squares
again (the shape is replaced by diagonal lines).  There are eight
pairs of shapes to try to match.

If you wish to stop the game at any time, press S and the placement of
all the shapes will be shown.  After each game you have the option of
trying again -- with the shapes scrambled in a different random order.

Other Applications 

Take a look at the BASIC logic in this game, then design your own.
You may wish to use the capabilities of the TI-99/4A graphics and draw
other pictures -- animals, people, designs, etc.  Each shape here is
drawn in a separate character set, and a random foreground and
background color combination is chosen.  Keep your drawing to eight or
fewer graphics characters; you may also want to specify a certain
foreground and background color.

You can make this matching game into an educational game.  Instead of
matching shapes, match an answer to a mathematics problem; match a
capital city to its state; match a date to a historical event; match
parts of a compound word.  Whatever you want.
