CLOSEOUT

  "Closeout" uses the concept of artificial intelligence to create an
  interesting chase game.

There's a huge sale going on at a local department store.  You arrive
at the multistory building hungry for bargains. Boldly, you enter the
store, look around, and see bargains galore.  A real sale!  Gathering
up sale items, you suddenly become aware of two other shoppers.
Wherever you go, they follow you.  Soon you learn their true
intentions -- they are out to stop you at all costs so they can have
the store to themselves.

The object of "Closeout" is to snatch up as many sale items as
possible while evading the hostile bargain hunters.  Don't let them
get too close -- if they capture you, the game is over.

You start on the ground floor at the bottom-left corner.  Use the
arrow keys to move left, right, up, or down.  You may go up or down
only at the escalators or at the elevators at the ends of the floors.
Pick up the sale items by moving your character over the colored dots.
If a fellow shopper gets too aggressive, you can deliver a shove that
will send him reeling up to the top floor simply by pressing the space
bar.  But when you do, you lose 25 sale items.  You start out with
three shoves, and with each screen you clear you earn another one.
Shoves can't be used on the escalators or elevators though.
