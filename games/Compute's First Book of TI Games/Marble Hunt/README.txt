MARBLE HUNT

  by Ronny Ong
  Translated for the TI by C. Regena

  "Marble Hunt" is a unique kind of maze game.  It has no maze!
  Without guiding corridors, the player must exercise control while
  keeping up with the fast pace of the game.

You are the red player on the playground.  The object is to try to
pick up as many marbles as you can, but watch out for the bully!  If
the bully catches you, the game is over.  You have a slight advantage
because your player can wrap around to the opposite edge of the
screen, but the bully cannot, so you should plan your strategy
accordingly.
