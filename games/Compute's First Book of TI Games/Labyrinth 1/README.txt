LABYRINTH 1

  by C. Regena

  You're caught in a cave with numerous passageways.  "Labyrinth 1"
  tests your ability to find your way out of the cave.

"Labyrinth 1" is a maze game for one person.  This game uses a method
that may print an "impossible" maze -- that is, you could be
completely blocked in.  After the labyrinth is printed, you have the
option to print a different labyrinth in case you did get an
impossible situation.

You are caught in the labyrinth at the left edge of the screen.  The
object of the game is to get to the opposite side in as few moves as
possible. Use the arrow keys to move up, down, left, or right.  If you
get to a barrier and prefer to dig through it rather than go around,
press ENTER, but it will cost 10 points.  Your score is printed during
the game.
