RIVER TRIP

  by C. Regena

  This game uses the natural scrolling of the screen to create good
  movement.

Watch out for the rocks.  Beware of fallen trees.  And be sure not to
run into the shore.  White-water rafting trips can be fun, but you
have to know what you are doing.

"River Trip" takes advantage of the natural scrolling created by
constantly printing to the screen.  You are in charge of the river
trip.  Your responsibility is to maneuver the raft safely to the end
of its journey.

That yellow face is you in your raft.  Use the left and right arrow
keys to try to keep the raft on the river.  Sound easy?  The river is
constantly meandering, and there are other obstacles to avoid.
