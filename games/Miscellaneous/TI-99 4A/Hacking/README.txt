HACKING

"Hacking" is one of the (many) simulated "hack into the computer"
programs written in the wake of WarGames.  Try logging in as "VODKA",
then listing "COMRADES".

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "003c.dsk/XHACKING".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC, but no further information is known.
