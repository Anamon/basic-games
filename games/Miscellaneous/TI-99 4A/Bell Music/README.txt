BELL MUSIC

This program, "Bell Music", plays some music that sounds like chimes,
coupled with floating plaid sprites.  (I don't recognize the
composition.)

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0040.dsk/BELL/MUSIC".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC, but no further information is known.
