2-LINE GAME

The main loop of this game really is just two lines.  Use S and D to
keep the car on the winding road.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0025.dsk/2LINEGAME".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC and apparently by Jim Peterson, but
no further information is known.
