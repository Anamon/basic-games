CAVALIER 'CHUTE

Now it's time for a little more action.  In this game you battle
wayward wind drifts while attempting to land your parachute safely on
a tiny landing pad floating on the waves of the Great
(computer-simulated) Ocean.

You start by selecting the level at which you want to play:

    SELECT YOUR GAME:
         A - EASY
         B - MODERATE
         C - DIFFICULT
         D - INCREDIBLY HARD
                    ? C

The computer will print out your parachute over and over again as it
descends, while you try to guide it onto the landing pad floating on
the waves below.

Use the "Z" key to move the parachute to the left and the "M" to move
to the right.  Miss the pad, and you'll drown!

Try to stop your heart from pounding, and get ready to leap from your
plane with this program written by Neal Cavalier-Smith.
