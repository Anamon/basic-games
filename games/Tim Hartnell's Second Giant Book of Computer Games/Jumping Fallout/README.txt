JUMPING FALLOUT

In this fascinating game, you have to try and shuffle the digits from
one to nine down from the top of this little grid to the bottom:

    0 12 456789
    1 ##3######
    2 ##### ###
    3 #  ### ##
    4 # ##### #
    5 # #######
    6 ######
    7 ## # ####
    8 #### # ##

    SCORE: 200
    WHICH LEVEL DO YOU WANT TO MOVE (1-8)
                ? 1
    HOW MANY MOVES TO THE LEFT? 7

As you can see, the number "3" is already on its way down.  When you
see the WHICH LEVEL DO YOU WANT TO MOVE? question, enter a number from
one to eight.  Follow the HOW MANY MOVES TO THE LEFT? question with
the number of spaces you want to move this level to the left.  As you
can see, in the move shown above I indicated that I wanted to move
level one a total of seven places to the left.

The object of this game (also written by Neal Cavalier-Smith) is to
get all of the digits to "fall out" of the bottom of the grid with the
smallest possible number of moves.  You start the game with 200
points, and points are subtracted from your score with each move.
You'll see, if you look closely at the sample run, that you lose more
points for moving the lower rows than you do for the top ones.  Once
you've mastered the game in its present form, set yourself the task of
getting all the numbers out, in order.
