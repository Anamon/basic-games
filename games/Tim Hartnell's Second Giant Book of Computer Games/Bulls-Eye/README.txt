BULLS-EYE

With this archery program you can shoot an arrow aimed straight for
the center of the target -- without leaving your keyboard.

The target appears like this on your screen:

          1  2  3  4  5  6  7
        -----------------------
    1 :      +  +  +  +  +      : 1
    2 :   +  #  #  #  #  #  +   : 2
    3 :   +  #  %  %  %  #  +   : 3
    4 :   +  #  %  *  %  #  +   : 4
    5 :   +  #  %  %  %  #  +   :  5
    6 :   +  #  #  #  #  #  +   : 6
    7 :      +  +  +  +  +      : 7
        -----------------------
          1  2  3  4  5  6  7
	  
The "+" signs on your target are worth two points, hitting the "#"
symbols gain you three points, you get five for the "%" and ten for
hitting the "*", the bulls-eye.

You "hit" areas of the target by pressing the space bar of your
computer to stop the series of numbers which appears on the screen.

Once you've done this, the computer will reprint the target, showing
the shot number, the score you gained from that shot, and your
cumulative score for the game.

At the end, the program will announce your score for the game, and
compare it against your previous best score.

By all means modify the appearance of the target to take advantage of
the graphics on your computer.  It doesn't really matter what you do
with the target visually -- so long as the various sections are shown
clearly -- as the "real" target is the Z(7, 7) array that the program
checks your shots against.

Here's the listing so that you can send a few arrows on their way.
