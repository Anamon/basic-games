MINE-SWEEPER

You are now commanding a mine-sweeper, with the task of clearing a
path through the heavily mined Juicy Straits Canal, so that oil
tankers can get through.

Each section of the canal is split into a ten by fifteen grid.  Each
separate location in this grid can contain a mine.  Although you can't
actually see the mines, your rusty old mine-detector can tell when a
mine is in one of the eight locations that surround your position.

Your ship's position on the grid is shown by a number, which also
indicates how many mines are in the "square" of eight locations
surrounding you.  By backtracking, and by going around mines when you
sense them, you can create a clear path from the left-hand side of the
screen to the row of #'s on the right-hand side.

Now for the bad news.  If you move onto a mine, you'll be blown
sky-high.

As you can see from the following sample run, you move around the
screen by entering U(p), D(own), R(ight) or L(eft).  You leave a clear
trail of blank locations for the tankers to use behind you as you
traverse the grid.

At the end of each level, the grid will be reprinted, with the mines
shown in position.  Your score is related to how direct your path
across the screen has been, and to the number of mines in that
particular segment of the canal.  Each time you finish a level, you'll
be given a new grid, with more mines on it.  (MINE-SWEEPER was written
