RETRO-ACTION

Zip-ee-dee-doo!  Here's a fast-moving reaction game for two players.

You're both seated at the keyboard, fingers poised.  The screen
flashes, and you both jab at the keys.  There can only be one winner.
Let the person with the best trigger finger be the victor.

When the program (which was written by Les Battyanyi and Todd
Harrison) is up and running, you'll see a line drawn on the screen,
followed by a series of pairs of circles.  After four pairs of them
have appeared, each pair closer and closer together, an arrow (formed
out of asterisks) will be shown.  If it points to the left, the
left-hand player must react, and hit the "A" key.  If the arrow is
pointing to the right, the right-hand player has to move into action,
hitting the ";" key. Hitting the key out of turn will cost you dearly.
When the arrow points straight down, the first player to react scores
points.

The first player to reach 100 points wins the laurel wreath.
