THE BIG MAZE

In this remarkable program, from London programmer Tony Pearson, you
(represented by the letter "I") move through a maze, heading for the
exit (represented by "X").  You can request a view of the maze from
above at any time.  The program will draw a map showing you where you
are, where you've been, and where you want to go.

The challenging aspect of the maze comes into play when, instead of
looking at the entire maze from above, you stay "within" it, and look
(or move) in a particular direction.  You'll see a view of the maze
for a short distance in the direction you requested.  It may take a
few runs of the program before you are able to visualize the maze, but
it's well worth the trouble -- this is a fascinating program to run.
