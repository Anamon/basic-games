CAR THIRTEEN

In this game you become one of "New York's Finest," as the police in
Gotham are inexplicably called.  You are patrolling the city in CAR
THIRTEEN, waiting to respond to a radio call.

You may feel that the city you're patrolling is a little smaller than
the New York you remember, but that's the result of spending too much
time in front of your computer, and not enough time in the Real
World. Here's the city map:

                    E Street
                    :
     _______________: 7th Street

    |______|__|__|__| 6th Street
    |      |  |  |

In contrast to many programs in which you have to locate an object on
a grid, the target in this program does not stand still.  In fact, it
does its level best to evade you at every turn.

Your car radio informs you that a robbery has been committed.  You
have to capture the crooks by landing on the corner they are currently
occupying.

You are given information regarding the location of the crook's car.
Try and nab him as soon as possible.  To make this challenging game
(by Martin Richardson) harder, the crook has a secret hideout which
changes from game to game.  If he gets there before he's caught, the
game is over, and you're the loser.

Polish up your blue light, officer, and get into action with this
listing.
