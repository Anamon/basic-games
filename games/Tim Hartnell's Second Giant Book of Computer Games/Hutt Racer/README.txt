HUTT RACER

This moving graphics game (written by Ian Hutt, who lives near Hampton
Court Palace in England) places you at the wheel of a racing car,
trying to reach the end of a twisting, turning track.  As if this
wasn't difficult enough, the track gets narrower as the race
progresses.  This program demands close concentration.

An additional hazard is the devilish "jam car," which can block your
path down the track.  The exhaust of the jam car is shown as an
exclamation mark (!) on the screen.  The jam car itself is shown as a
"V."  You can drive through the exhaust, but (of course) you are not
allowed to smash into the vehicle ahead of it.  If you're just one
space away from the car, the exhaust will turn into a plus sign (+) to
warn you that you're too close.  At the end of the game you'll be told
how far you traveled.

The position of your car is shown by the "W" at the very bottom of the
display.  Move your car left with the "Z" key and right with the "M".
Look out for "!" and "+"!
