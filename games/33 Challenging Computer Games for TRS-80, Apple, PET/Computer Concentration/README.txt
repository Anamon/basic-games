Computer Concentration 

You'll have to get out your thinking cap for this one.  10 questions
will be printed about television, past and present.  After you answer
each one, a clue word to a mystery sentence or statement will be
printed.  After all 10 questions, all clue words will be printed
(maybe).  You must place these words together to match the sentence
that the computer has in memory.

The second half of the game also contains 10 questions.  These will be
of general knowledge.  The clue word or word(s) will be torn apart and
each time you answer a question correctly a letter to the ciue word
will be printed.  If you answer incorrectly no new letters will be
printed.  When you are ready to guess, your word must match the
computer's word exactly.  For obvious reasons all answers were left
out of the sample run.
