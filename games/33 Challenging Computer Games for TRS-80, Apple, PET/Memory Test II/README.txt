Memory Test II

Memory Test II takes over where the previous Memory Test One left off.
This test has three categories, numbers, names and places.  How you
rate your memory will determine the length of time that a word or
number will be printed on the screen.

This program could be a great help to your school age children.  You
could change the DATA in lines 230, 280 and 290 to insert words that
they have trouble spelling, then when the program is run, you could
not only test their memory but brush up on their spelling.

As with the previous Memory Test, no sample run is included.  To do so
would forfeit the numbers, names and places.  See Fig. 4-3 for the
flowchart of this program.
