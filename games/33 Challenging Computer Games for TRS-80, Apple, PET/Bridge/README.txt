The Bridge

In this simulation you will try to blow up a bridge before the enemy
has time to advance their troops across it.  Everything will be
computer selected, so, to complete your mission, you must match the
computer's selected weak areas (of bridge) and the amount of dynamite
needed.  Also, you must remember the name of the bridge you are to
blow up.
