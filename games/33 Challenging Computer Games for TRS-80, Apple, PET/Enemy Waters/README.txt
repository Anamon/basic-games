Enemy Waters 

You and your computer are in an experimental sub, your mission --
destroy enemy ships.  You will input the commands to fire the
torpedos; the computer will print damage (if any), compute distance to
ship, and if torpedo does miss the computer will tell you why.

Fasten the hatch... we're about to dive!
