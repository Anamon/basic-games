Alphabetize 

This game teaches the young (or young at heart) to put words in
alphabetical order.  You can easily modify this program to suit your
needs, such as changing the DATA STATEMENTS to add new words, or
adding more than 10 words per set.  Just be sure to change the DIM
STATEMENT, line 10, to fit the amount of words used (per set).
