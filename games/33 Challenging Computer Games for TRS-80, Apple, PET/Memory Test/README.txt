Memory Test

See how good your memory really is.  If you think your memory is
excellent, this program will let you know for sure.  Don't cheat by
writing the words on paper as they're listed on the screen; to do so
would beq to miss the whole point of the test!!

After you or your friends tire of the same words, you can change the
DATA in lines 40, 50 and 60 to suit your needs.  How you rate your
memory will determine the amount of time a word will be printed on the
screen.  Meaning if you rate your memory as excellent, the words will
be printed only a short time.  Rating your memory as poor has an
opposite effect the words are printed for a long duration.

Because of the words and point of the test, no sample run is included
-- to do this would be to render the test useless.  But remember,
after each word is printed, the screen will clear after an allotted
amount of time.  See Fig. 4-2 for the flowchart for this program.
