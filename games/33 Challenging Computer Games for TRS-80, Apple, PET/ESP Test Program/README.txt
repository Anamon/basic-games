ESP Test Program

Now you can test your mind to see if or how good your Extra Sensory
Perception really is.  The program is sectioned into two parts, the
first part requires two people, the second part you do on your own.
No sample run is provided as this would defeat the program's purpose,
but you can get a really good idea of the program by reading the print
statements.  See Fig. 4-1 for the flowchart for this program.
