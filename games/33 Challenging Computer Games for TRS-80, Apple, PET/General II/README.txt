General II 

The game where you and your opponent will battle one another until one
of you loses all his men.  You'll input where you want your men to be
located, then the amount of men.  The computer will scramble
positions, areas and men, just in case your opponent was watching the
video when you entered all the information.  Then, with a little
common sense (and mostly guessing), your opponent will station his men
to try and match yours.  If he misses he'll lose an undetermined
amount of men.  If he's successful -- you'll lose all men put at that
position!!

Good Luck Generals!!
