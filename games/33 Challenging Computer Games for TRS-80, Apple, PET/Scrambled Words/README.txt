Scrambled Words

This game program lets you unscramble 17 different words.  The
computer will give you 2 chances to unscramble each word, after which
you'll be asked to select another.

The words are about people, places and things.  But you can modify
this game to suit your wishes.  Examples are: use all names, names of
cars, movie titles just to name a few.  There is no sample run for
this program, to unscramble the words for you would be defeating the
purpose of the game.  See Fig. 3-4 for the flowchart for this program.
