HI-DI 

This is an original computer game that is similar to Blackjack in some
ways, but uses a simulated roll of dice to achieve its purpose.  The
idea of this game is to get 7 points or less with the roll of a
maximum of 3 dice.  You may stop after the first roll or roll one or
two more in die event that your numbers are low.  When you have
finished your roll, the computer will begin its roll.  In this case, a
tie does not go to the computer, but is registered as a tie and
another game may be played.  If you go over 7, you automatically lose
and the computer does not have to roll.  This program always assumes
that you roll first, and the computer has the advantage in that it
will determine how many dice it must roll based upon your final score,
assuming it is 7 or less.
