BINGO CALLER 

This program is short and sweet, but believe it or not, it can
completely take the place of those expensive bingo outfits that are
often used by civic organizations to raise funds.  You've probably
seen the type that uses numbered ping pong balls, which float around
on a cushion of air.  These are often coupled with an electronic
display that will light up the same number on a large electronic
screen once the ping pong ball is placed in its correct slot.  Some of
these outfits cost thousands of dollars, but if you have the TI-99/4A
computer and a large screen television receiver, you can accomplish
the same thing for less money, and the computer version has no moving
parts.
