GRAPHIC DICE

No computer game book would be complete without a program that
simulated a dice roll.  This one goes a step further, however, and
actually draws the cubes on the screen so the display is far more
realistic than those programs that simply print numbers on the screen.

It's quite simple to set up a dice routine.  All that is involved is
the outputting of two separate random numbers from 1 to 6.  Indeed,
many dice programs do this and nothing else.  Some will add the two
numbers together, and still others will build in program lines to
react to certain sums, such as 2 (Snake Eyes), or 12 (Box Cars).

This dice program uses two random numbers that are integers and are
within the range of 1 to 6, but it feeds this information to a long
series of program lines that produce on-screen graphics that draw the
dice faces to correspond to the numbers generated.
