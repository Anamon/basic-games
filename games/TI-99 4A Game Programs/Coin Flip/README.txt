COIN FLIP 

One of the simplest random chance games to simulate on a computer is
the flip of a coin.  From a computer standpoint, the flip involves
only two possible random numbers, 1 or 2.  This assumes that there are
only two possible results when a coin is flipped, one side or the
other, better known as heads or tails.  Of course, from a realistic
standpoint, this is not entirely correct, since there is a very, very
slight possibility that the coin could land on its edge and remain in
this position.  Since this is a million to one shot, we won't even
consider it.
