LETTER CONFUSION

Letter Confusion is an extremely interesting program, from both the
player's and the programmer's point of view.  The game is potentially
unlimited and may be reseeded with new words at any time.  The idea of
the game is to unscramble a combination of letters that appear on the
screen in order to come up with the correct word.  In some cases, it
is possible to make two or more words from the letters (rare), but
there is always only one correct answer.  A scorekeeping routine is
included in the program, so once all of the scrambled words have been
presented and the player has input his best guess for each, a final
tally appears, indicating the number of correct answers as well as the
number that were incorrect.

This program is designed to be enjoyed by persons of all ages and
educational levels.  No modifications are required to switch from a
juvenile player to an adult.  Three difficulty levels are built into
this program.  The first one is extremely elementary and is designed
for children.  The second one is probably the one that most adults
will start with and is rated intermediate in difficulty.  The third
level is for the experts and includes some extremely complex
scrambles.
