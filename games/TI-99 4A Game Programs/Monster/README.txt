MONSTER 

Monster is a game that revolves around random occurrences just like a
dice game, except that instead of 6 possible results as in the case
with a single die, there are 9 possibilities.  This game uses
on-screen graphics to draw a series of 9 boxes horizontally on the
screen.  Each one of these boxes is represented as a door, and above
each door, there is a number from 1 to 9.  You open the door of your
choice by typing its number and then pressing the enter key.  The door
will then disappear if there's nothing behind it, but if this is the
door the monster has been hiding behind, it will spring out at you
with a growl.

Each time you select a door (without getting the monster), the door
will disappear, but the identifying number overhead will remain.  When
the door with the monster is selected, the entire screen is cleared,
and the monster appears.  At the same time, the excellent audio
qualities of the TI-99/4A are utilized to produce a low-frequency
noise that sounds like a growl.
