COIN FLIP 2

Coin Flip 2 is almost identical to the previous program, except that
two hypothetical coins are used.  Two random numbers are set up and
assigned to X and Y.  Again, the range is from 1 to 2, with 1
representing heads and 2 representing tails for both coins.  When this
program is run, the results of flipping the two coins are displayed on
the screen.  This allows for even/odd matching, which is a quite
common coin flip game.
