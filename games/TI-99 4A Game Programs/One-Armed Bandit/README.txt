ONE-ARMED BANDIT 

Slot machine games can be programmed very easily on most
microcomputers.  Indeed, some may even have some of the symbols needed
in their character set.  This is not the case with the TI-99/4A, but
it is quite easy to build up a number of graphic characters to
represent the fruit on the real slot machines.  This program uses a
graphic heart, cherry, and bar to represent three slot machine
windows.  A win occurs when three of any one type of item line up in a
row.  Anything else is a loser.  You may be surprised, however, at the
number of times an in-line matchup occurs.  This will certainly happen
more often than on those machines in Vegas or Atlantic City.
