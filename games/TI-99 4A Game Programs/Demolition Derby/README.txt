DEMOLITION DERBY

This is a fairly long and complex program that simulates a demolition
derby comprised of four automobiles.  The automobiles will be colored
red, green, yellow, and blue, and up to four players can each choose a
car as their own.  When the program is run, these tiny automobiles
will appear on the screen for a few seconds, disappear, and then
reappear in a different location.  If two automobiles come in close
contact with each other, there will be a crash sound, and one of them
will disappear from the screen.  The sequence keeps up until only one
automobile is left. The player who has chosen this color is the
winner.  Sometimes, two automobiles will remain on the screen and
never seem to damage each other.  If you become tired of waiting, you
can always declare the run a draw and start over again.  Sometimes,
two automobiles will collide without damaging each other severely
enough to take one out of the game.  Also, there is the possibility
that an automobile which was previously damaged (slightly) will
suddenly overheat and be taken out.

This game depends solely upon random chance to take automobiles out of
the running and determine a winner.  All the players have to do is
select a color, start the program, and sit back and wait.
