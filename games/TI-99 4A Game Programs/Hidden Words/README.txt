HIDDEN WORDS

Hidden Words is a computer-assisted game that also involves pencil and
paper.  Most readers will remember the word games they played as
children (and sometimes as adults) that involved a long conglomeration
of letters that the players used to make words.  Any letter that was
found in that conglomeration could be used to form part of a word.
The person who made the most words from the string was the winner.

This program randomly outputs a conglomeration of letters with which
players can attempt to form words.  Each output from the computer will
consist of ten letters.  When you press the enter key again, a new
string of letters is output.
