ONE MILLION WORDS

Here is a program that I just happened across while writing a more
complex one which will be presented next.  The name of this program is
quite applicable in that it can display one million words or more if
you play it long enough.  This is a hidden word puzzle with little or
no logic behind it.  Chances are, you've seen many of these puzzles in
various magazines.  A large number of letters is printed horizontally
and vertically on the page with certain words occurring horizontally,
vertically, diagonally, and in reverse order.  Most of the letters are
simply a jumble, but some of them line up to form the words that must
be extracted.  This is usually done by circling the word.

This program works along similar lines, except all letters are
generated on a random basis.  No specific English words are actually
programmed for, although they will certainly occur during every
program run.  A total of 616 letters will be generated on each screen,
and it is then up to the players (two or more) to extract as many
words as possible from this maze.  Although no true words are
purposely programmed, I guarantee that you will be surprised at some
of the words that crop up at random.
