SPEEDREAD/TYPE 

Speedread/Type is a learning game that will allow you to sharpen your
speedreading skills and practice typing on the TI-99/4A at the same
time.  When the program is first run, a single line of words and/or
numbers is displayed on the screen for a second or so.  As soon as the
phrase disappears, you must duplicate it by typing in the same
information via the keyboard.  The keyboard information must be
identical to what appeared on the screen or a wrong answer is
recorded.  At the end of the game, the number of incorrect phrases is
registered as your score.  The individual with the lowest score is the
winner.
