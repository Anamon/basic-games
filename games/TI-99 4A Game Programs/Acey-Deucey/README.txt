ACEY-DEUCEY 

Acey-Deucey is a computerized version of the card game which goes by
the same name.  The screen will display three numbers.  The one in the
center must lie between the first and last number shown numerically.
In other words, if the first and last numbers are 5 and 10
respectively, any number from 6 to 9 is a winner, since it lies
between 5 and 10.  Any number less than 5 or greater than 10 is a
loser.  Likewise, the numbers 5 or 10 are losers.

In the card game, the face cards always counted as 10, the other cards
counted as their face values, and the ace could be a 1 or an 11.  In
this game, only numbers are used, and these will range from 1 to 11.
You do not have the option of allowing an 11 to be equal to 1 or 11.
This is already written into the program.
