MATCHGAME

Matchgame is not really a game, but it can be used to randomly match
up partners for true games.  For example, it can be used to match up
sides for a touch football game.  The way it is written here, it's
really designed as a dating game, in that it allows you to input the
names of up to 10 boys and then the names of a like number of girls.
When all names have been input, partners will be randomly matched.
