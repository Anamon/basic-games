STATES AND CAPITALS

Here's a straightforward program that is a great tutorial for school
age children and will also stymy many adults who haven't had to deal
with the capitals of various states for many years.  The program is
extremely simple, but it is long due to the fact that each data
statement contains the name of a state, along with its capital.  It
would have been possible to conserve a fair amount of memory by
including several states and their capitals on a single data statement
line.  However, this method assures easy debugging and makes the
program content much more clear.
