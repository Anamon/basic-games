MATH GAME

Another mathematics game that is enjoyed by a wide range of
individuals involves the display of math problems on the screen.
Naturally, the player is supposed to come up with the correct answer.
This version is fairly simple, but by changing the random value range
in lines 340 and 350, the difficulty level can be increased or
decreased.  This program displays addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division problems on the screen.

By decreasing the random number range, the difficulty factor can be
lowered for children.  You may also wish to omit the multiplication
and division aspects and simply leave the addition and subtraction
problems.  As you can see, this program can be easily tailored to meet
the needs of a wide range of individuals and is popular with young and
old alike.
