SPIN THE BOTTLE

Here is the perfect Spin the Bottle game.  It is designed to be played
by two couples whose names are input at the beginning.  Unlike the
conventional Spin the Bottle game, the computer determines who will
kiss who, and it always matches the immediate participants up on a
boy/girl basis.  This game uses a bit of on-screen graphics to point
to the names of the players who are to kiss.  The names of the girls
are input first, and these will appear on the screen at the left and
right hand sides.  The boys' names will appear vertically at the top
and bottom.  This arrangement forms a crude circle.  When you press
the enter key, the spin occurs, and a two-headed pointer will indicate
the names of those persons who can kiss.  Any combination is possible,
but it will always be on a boy/girl basis, provided that the names
were properly input at the beginning.
