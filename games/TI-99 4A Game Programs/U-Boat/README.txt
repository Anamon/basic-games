U-BOAT 

U-Boat is a simple arcade-like program that graphically displays a
blue ocean and a ship moving across its surface.  The player assumes
the position of U-boat captain and is allowed three torpedoes to try
and sink the ship.  This game involves a bit of intuitiveness, as the
path of the torpedoes is controlled randomly.  However, these random
paths fall within a certain confined area, and after you've played the
game awhile, it is possible to get higher scores based on the torpedo
path patterns experienced previously.  The torpedoes are fired by
pressing any key on the keyboard, and you will see the path of each as
it travels through the water toward the ship.  The ship must be struck
dead center in order to score a kill.  When this occurs, you will hear
the explosion.  Later, the screen will clear and a new ship and ocean
will appear, giving you a chance to make another kill.  If the ship
makes it from one side of the screen to the other, the screen clears
and another pass begins.  This is a very simple game, but it is quite
pleasurable and can provide many hours of enjoyment to both adults and
children alike.
