[Note: This game requires TI BASIC and will not run in TI Extended
Basic, which allows fewer characters to be redefined.]

RAM BLASTER

You are the dreaded RAM-rammer, trying to destroy all the computer
components on the screen.

When you first run the game, you'll see the points you can score for
hitting each kind of component.  You move using the arrow keys, and
fire by pressing the space bar.  Note that you can only fire by
pressing the space bar as you move.  The little black bullet always
moves in the direction you are currently travelling.
