ENCHANTED FOREST

This 'mini-Adventure', based on a program created by Toni Baker and
converted for the TI by Tim Hartnell.  places you within a strange
forest... made up entirely of numbered triangles.

The occupants of the Enchanted Forest, and the effect on you when you
move into a triangle where they are, are as follows:

  FAIRIES — these will not harm you, but will move you at random to a
      new triangle within the forest.

  GOBLINS — these are definitely nasty, and will kill you if you have
      the temerity to move into any of their sectors.

  THE DRAGON — land in his triangle, and you're a goner!

The aim of the game is to kill the dragon.  You have a limited number
of arrows (set at five in line 40).  You fire them into any segment
(which you think contains the dragon) by entering the number of the
triangle, preceded by a minus sign (that is, you enter -41 to shoot
into triangle 41).  You'll soon become quite adept at working out
where the dragon is likely to be -- although he does move from game to
game.
