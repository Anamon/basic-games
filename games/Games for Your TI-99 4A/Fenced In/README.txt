FENCED IN

James Turner has contributed this hard-to-beat game, in which you have
to get from the top left-hand corner of the screen to the bottom
right-hand one, through a field of electric fences.

You are only allowed to touch five fences before you die (and the
graphic result of dying is enough to tempt you to do it deliberately).
Each time you touch a fence, you'll clear a few other fences away;
this will make it easier to get to your goal.

In this game of strategy, there is no back-tracking (you can only move
right, and down) so you must work out your moves in advance.  You use
the 'M' key to move down, and the 'L' key to move right.
