DARING DAMON

You can now indulge your wicked, secret vice of gambling.  The program
demonstrates how effective moving graphics can be in ordinary BASIC.

The game is a horse-racing one.  After you have placed your bets, the
race will begin.  The barriers move past your horses as they make
their way down the track (extremely effective graphics are used for
the horses' legs).

Full instructions are contained within the program.  If you want to
alter the speed at which the horses run, modify the random number
generated within the program.  You can also change the horses' names
by changing the DATA statements.
