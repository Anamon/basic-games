ARECIBO ATTACK

This is a simple, but highly effective, 'space shoot' game from James
Turner that tests your ability to make spatial judgements.  You have
to try and shoot down a blinking alien as it passes overhead.  As the
alien gets lower and lower, its descent speed is increased.

To win the game, you have to kill five aliens.  The space bar is used
to fire; you move left with the 'Z' key, and right with the "." key.
