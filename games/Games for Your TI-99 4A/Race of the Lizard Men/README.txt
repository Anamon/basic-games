RACE OF THE LIZARD MEN

Wilton J. Faberge's user-defined graphics (which do, I suppose, look
vaguely like 'lizard men') trundle slowly across the screen in a race
for the winner's laurel wreath.  Place your bets, and then see if
lizard man one or two gets across the screen first.

If you wish to change their appearance, modify the strings A$ to H$ in
lines 500 to 570.
