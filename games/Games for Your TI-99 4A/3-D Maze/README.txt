3-D MAZE

In this game, you have to try and find a secret room hidden within a
vast mansion, designed by the mad architect, T.I. McNinetyniner.
Although the maze remains the same from game to game, the location of
the room you are searching for changes each time you run the program.

The room is presented graphically in front of you, creating quite an
uncanny feeling of 'reality' as the walls move past you.  You move
using the arrow keys.

You will be asked to enter your choice of colours when you run the
program.  Start by entering 14,2 which works very well.  Then you can
choose your own colour combinations on subsequent runs.
