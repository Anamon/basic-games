CITY BOMBER

This is a classy adaptation of the old arcade favourite; you drop
bombs on a series of high-rise buildings in order to clear a landing
strip for your plane.

The program uses some very effective graphics, including a 'random
explosion' which changes from game to game.  You will find this
program a tough nut to crack.

Use any key to fire.
