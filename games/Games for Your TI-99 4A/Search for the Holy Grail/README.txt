SEARCH FOR THE HOLY GRAIL

Now you can take on the Monty Python team at their own quest, as you
traverse the lonely fields of the TV screen in search of the Grail.

In actual fact, you don't have to search very hard (as the Grail is
shown plainly on the screen from the beginning of the game).  However,
knowing where it is and actually getting to it are two quite different
things.  You have to get to the Grail through a maze of walls built of
odd-shaped stones.

You move through the maze using the arrow keys.  Your path to the
Grail is impeded by a ferocious dragon, hell-bent on your destruction.
Thanks to clever programming, the dragon is relatively intelligent.
It is after you at all times, and is able to move through walls, so
you really haven't got much hope!

If you manage to get to the Grail on the first screen shown, a new
maze will be created.  However, this second maze is invisible.  All
you will see on the screen is the Grail, yourself, and the dragon.

As an extra twist, a bouncing ball will appear on the screen which you
would be well advised to beware.
