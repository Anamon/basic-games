TEXAS TENBY 

Texas Tenby is a gambling game played with dice.  Written by Tim
Hartnell, it is based on the game of Craps.  It is very simple to play
(but not so easy to win).  There are 10 rounds to each game.

You roll two dice, and add their totals.  The game ends on the first
roll if the dice total 7 or 11.  These totals, when gained on the
first roll, are called 'a natural'; if you roll them you win.

If you roll 2, 3 or 12 on the first roll ('craps') you lose.  Any
other total becomes your 'point'.  To win, you need to roll your point
again, before rolling a 7.

You will find that the TI does most of the work for you, rolling the
dice, checking your wins and losses, and keeping track of things.  The
best way to play it is with a friend; take it in turns to 'roll the
dice', with rolls 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 for you, and the other rolls for
your friend.
