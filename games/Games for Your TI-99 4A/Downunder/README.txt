DOWNUNDER

Kevin Burfitt uses his computer to recreate some of the Australian
landscape.  You have to move your kangaroo down the screen to the door
you can see near the bottom.  As you bounce down you have to make sure
you don't run into the river, the dingo, the platypus or the wombat.

You have extremely limited time to get to the door.  You can increase
your strength, and thus add to your chances of getting to the door, by
eating the Vegemite that appears on the screen.  (Vegemite, by the
way, is a black paste which Aussies eat on nearly everything.  It is
extremely good for kangaroos.)

Once you get to the door, a new screen will appear; this one will be
more difficult to navigate through.
