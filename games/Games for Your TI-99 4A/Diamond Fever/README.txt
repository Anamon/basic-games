DIAMOND FEVER

Here is another great game -- which makes effective use of TI graphics
-- written by Kevin Burfitt.  You are alone on an asteroid in deepest
space when the program begins.  While scanning the asteroid, you
notice it has a high metal-to-rock ratio.  As a miner, you realise
that you will be extremely wealthy if you mine the asteroid for its
ore.

But your dreams of easy riches are shattered when you see that there
is an evil Vogon spacecraft within the asteroid.  Your task is to move
from one side of the asteroid (you start on the left) to the exit on
the other side, before the Vogon gets you.

You have to drill your way out of the mine.  Metal takes a long time
to work through, and diamond is practically impossible to penetrate.
When the game is over, the location of the metal and diamonds will be
shown to you; you do not, however, know where they are when you are
trying to elude the Vogon.  Full instructions are given within the
program.
