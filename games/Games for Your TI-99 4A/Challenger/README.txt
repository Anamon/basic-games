CHALLENGER 

Wayne Southwick wrote this very effective moving graphics game.
Written in Extended BASIC, the program makes good use of sprites.

At the start of the game, you will be asked to enter your name.  If
you have a speech unit fitted, line 210 will inform you: "I think you
will like this space-type program."  You can delete this line (and
710) if you do not have a speech unit.

After entering your name, you will be given a few instructions.  You
are the white spaceship near the centre of the screen.  Several
coloured spacecraft fly past you -- at different speeds -- and you
have to try and dodge them.

If you do nothing, your craft will drift upwards.  Touch the 'X' key
and you will move downwards.  If you hit the red barriers at either
the top or the bottom of the screen the game will come to an end.

Your craft is fitted with shields which operate intermittently.  If
you are really desperate, you can chance flying through one of the
alien craft.  However, if your shields are not operating at that
instance, you will be killed â€”- and the game will end.
