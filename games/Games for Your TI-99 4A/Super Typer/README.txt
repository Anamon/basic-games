SUPER TYPER

In this dynamic game from K. Burfitt, you and your typing fingers are
set against a relentless clock, as you attempt to stop randomly-chosen
letters of the alphabet from crawling to the top of the screen.

Letters will appear at the bottom of the screen -- one by one -- and
then start making their way towards the top.  You have to press the
relevant letters on your keyboard before the letters reach the top of
the screen.  You will discover that the letters move more and more
quickly as your score gets higher.  There is a high-score feature.
