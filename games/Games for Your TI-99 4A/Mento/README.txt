MENTO

This program tests your powers of mental arithmetic and demonstrates
that your computer can apparently read minds.

A series of instructions will appear on the screen.  You have to carry
out each instruction, then press the ENTER key.  At the end, the
clever computer will tell you not only how old you are, but how much
change you have in your pocket!
