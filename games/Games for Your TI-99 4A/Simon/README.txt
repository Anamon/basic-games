SIMON

This is a memory-test program, in which you have to try and repeat a
constantly-growing string of digits.

The game starts quietly, with one digit.  The screen will clear, and
you have to enter the same number.  If you are right, the computer
will reprint the first number, and follow it with a second one.  Once
the screen has cleared again, you have to enter both numbers, in the
right order, pressing ENTER after each digit.

This harrowing process will continue until you either manage to get 10
digits in a row right, or you make a mistake.  You will be given a
score at the end of the game related to how well you did.
