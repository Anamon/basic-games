TI FASTERMIND

Now you can challenge your computer to the well-known game often
called 'Codebreaker'.  The computer picks a four-digit number (with no
digits repeated); you have to try and work out what the number is.

You have 10 attempts to do this.  After each guess, the computer will
respond with a score in 'blacks' and 'whites'.  The blacks represent
correct digits in correct positions within the code you entered;
whites are correct digits, but not in the right position.  This game
is based on a program by Toni Baker.
