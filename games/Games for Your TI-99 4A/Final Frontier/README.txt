FINAL FRONTIER

You won't have much time to catch your breath in this action game from
Damon Pillinger.

Once again, it is you who are the last hne of Earth's defence.  You
use the up and down arrow keys to position your craft, and the space
bar to fire.  The game becomes more and more difficult as it
progresses.
