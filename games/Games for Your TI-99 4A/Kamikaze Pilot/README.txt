KAMIKAZE PILOT

Take your fate in your hands and steer this tiny plane down a
twisting, turning tunnel.  The plane will drift to one side throughout
the game.  As you attempt to keep it under control, touch any key and
you will correct the drift.

There is a choice of nine levels, with the higher numbers representing
the higher (almost impossible) levels.  Once you think you have
developed some skill at this game, make it harder by reducing the
number of spaces (the game is listed with seven spaces) in lines 260
and 270.
