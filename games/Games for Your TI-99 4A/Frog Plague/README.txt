FROG PLAGUE

The frog's life is in your hands in this program from Damon Pillinger.

As the REM statements point out, you use the 'S' and 'D' keys to move
left and right, in an attempt to avoid the objects moving up the
screen towards you.  You have to keep out of the way of leaves, a
motorboat, rocks, logs and (hardest of all) bridges.

This is a game which, despite all your efforts, you are bound to lose
sometime.  Walls on the screen constantly move in on you, making it
harder and harder to avoid the dangerous objects.
