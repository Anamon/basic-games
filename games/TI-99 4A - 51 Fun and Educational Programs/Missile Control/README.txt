MISSILE CONTROL

You are sitting at tlie controls of a battery of SAM missiles
(surface-to-air missiles).  You hear that the enemy is about to launch
ten bombing attacks.  If your aim is good, you can destroy the enemy's
bombers and help win the war.

The enemy will start his attack when you press the ENTER key.  Fire
your missile whenever you think the path of the missile will cross the
path of the bomber (causing a "hit" to occur).  To fire your missile,
press the "F" key.

After each attack and at the end of the game, the computer will give
you your score.
