MICRO HANGMAN

In this game, the computer will give you a mystery word which you must
guess.  The computer will tell you how many letters are in the word.
Attempt to guess the word by typing in the most likely letter.
(Starting with one of the vowels is usually a good idea.)  If your
letter is in the word, the computer will tell you how many times it
occurs and will show you its position.  The remaining missing letters
will show up as dashes.  Continue trying new letters until you think
you know what the word is.  As soon as you think you know, type in the
word GUESS.  If you enter the correct guess, the computer will tell
you so and will go on to the next word.  If your guess is wrong, the
old word will reappear.

The objective is to get through all the words while using the fewest
number of letters possible.  The number in parentheses next to the
mystery word indicates how many letters you have tried so far.

The mystery words are contained in the DATA statements and they may be
easily changed whenever you wish.
