CHECK MATH HOMEWORK

Students in the early grades (first through sixth) can use this
program to check and grade their homework.

Unlike a calculator, this program will not give the answer to the
problem.  Instead, it will only tell the student if his answer is
correct or incorrect.  If his answer is incorrect, the student will
have to rework the problem since he does not know what the answer is.

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems are the
types that can be checked.  Scoring is automatic and a final score is
given at the end.
