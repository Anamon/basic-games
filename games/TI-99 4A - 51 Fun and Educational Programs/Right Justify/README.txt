RIGHT JUSTIFY

  A routine to right justify numbers 

Your TI computer normally prints numbers in a left justified way.
This means that numbers of different lengths are lined up on the left
side.  For example:

    1234
    4
    275

However, numbers are more readable when they are right justified, as
shown below:

    1234
       4
     275

The routine to right justify numbers begins in line 290 and can handle
any number up to seven digits.  You can use it in your own programs to
make your numbers more readable.
