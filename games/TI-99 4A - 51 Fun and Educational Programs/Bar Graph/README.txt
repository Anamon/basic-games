BAR GRAPH

  Creating a bar graph 

In a more serious application of tlie graphics capabilities of your
computer, this program is designed to illustrate how data can be
presented in a bar graph form.

The numbers to be graphed are shown in the DATA statements.  The last
such number must be -999 to indicate the end of the data.

You may easily apply this program to your own needs by using your own
numbers instead of those used in the example statements.  The program
has the ability to scale the data so that all the numbers will fit on
the screen.
