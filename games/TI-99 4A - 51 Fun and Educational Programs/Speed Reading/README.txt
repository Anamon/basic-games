SPEED READING

This program is designed to help you learn how to read better and
faster.  Sentences will be flashed on the screen.  Try to read each
sentence at a single glance rather than one word at a time.  After
some practice, you should be able to increase the speed at which the
sentences are presented and should still be able to understand the
meaning.

The speed at which the sentences are flashed is controlled by a number
from 1 (fastest) to 10 (slowest).  At the start, the computer will ask
you to enter this number.  You may want to experiment with different
speeds to see which is best for you.
