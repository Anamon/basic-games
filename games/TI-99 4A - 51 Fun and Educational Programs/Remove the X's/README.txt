REMOVE THE X'S

Here is a variation of the old matchsticks game, except that you play
against the computer.

We will start with 17 X's.  You are to remove 1, 2, or 3 X's.  The
computer will remove 1, 2, or 3.  This will proceed until you or the
computer is forced to remove the last X.  The one that removes the
last X loses the game.
