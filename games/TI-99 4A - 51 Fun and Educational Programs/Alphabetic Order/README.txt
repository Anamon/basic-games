ALPHABETICAL ORDER

  A program to sort in alphabetical order

You can use this program to sort a list of names into alphabetical
order.  Just place the names that are to be sorted in the DATA
statements.  Following the last name in the last DATA statement,
insert an END to let the program know where the list ends.  (Don't
confuse this with the END statement given in line 510, which
designates the end of the program.)
