FRACTION TO DECIMAL

  Changing from fractions to decimals

You can use this program to change a number from iis fractional form
to its decimal form.

Enter the fraction as you would write it (for example, 1/5 or 273).
This is somewhat different from most such programs, which require that
you enter the numerator, a comma, and then the denominator.  That's
because this program is able to recognize the numerator as the number
before the slash (/), and the denominator as the number after the
slash (/).

To end the program, press the FUNCTION-CLEAR keys.
