DOUBLE

  If I double my investment every year, how much will it be worth?

Wouldn't it be nice to own a stock, mutual fund, or other investment
that doubles in value every year.  If you could do this, even a small
amount of money would become quite large in just a few years.

This program lets you experiment with different starting amounts and
tells you how much your investment is worth at the end of every year,
for seven years.  So try it for yourself.  Start with small
investments, such as $100, $300, $1000, etc., and see how quickly your
money can grow.
