KEYBOARD CRAYON

Even if you don't own joysticks, you can still be a computer artist.
This program is similar to the preceding program, Joystick Crayon,
except that it lets you draw on the screen by using your keyboard, as
follows:

    Key    What Key Will Do
     E      DRAW UP
     X      DRAW DOWN
     D      DRAW RIGHT
     S      DRAW LEFT
     B      ERASE OR MOVE SQUARE WITHOUT DRAWING A LINE (BLANK MODE).
     C      CLEAR THE SCREEN
     W      BEGIN WRITING AGAIN AFTER BLANK MODE (WRITE MODE).

Note: Keys E, X, D, and S draw in the same direction as the arrows on
the keys.

Unlike the Joystick Crayon program, ALPHA LOCK need not be UP for this
program.  To end the program, hit the FUNCTION-CLEAR keys.
