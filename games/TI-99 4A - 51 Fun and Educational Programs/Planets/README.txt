PLANETS

This two-part exercise should help expand your knowledge of our solar
system.

In Part I, you are asked to name all the planets, in order, from the
sun outward.  Whenever you answer incorrectly, you will be given
another chance to get it right.  If you get stuck, enter the word HELP
and the computer will give you the correct name.

After you have named all the planets, Part II of the program will ask
you for your weight.  The computer will then tell you how much you
would weigh on all the other planets.
