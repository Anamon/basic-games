FAMILY BUDGET

  Let the computer figure your family budget

Your home computer can also be used to figure your family budget.
Each budget Item (such as food, car, gasoline, etc.) is contained in
the DATA statements.  To use the program for your own budget, replace
the example DATA statements given in the program with DATA statements
that reflect your own situation.

RUN the program to get the total budget and then save it for future
use.  Later, if any budget item changes, just retrieve the program,
make whatever changes are necessary by using your EDIT functions, and
RUN the program to get your new total.  Again, save the changed
program.
