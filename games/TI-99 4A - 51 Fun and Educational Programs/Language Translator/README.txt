LANGUAGE TRANSLATOR

Here is an interesting way to practice and learn the words of a
foreign language.

This program makes it possible for you to translate any of the English
words contained in its vocabulary into French and Spanish.  Just
indicate how you wish to translate (English to French or English to
Spanish) and give the computer the word you wish to translate.  The
translated word will appear on the screen next to your word.

The example vocabulary used in the program contains 14 words.  This
vocabulary may be easily changed or expanded.  You may even want to
adapt it to other languages.  All this can be easily done by just
changing the DATA statements.
