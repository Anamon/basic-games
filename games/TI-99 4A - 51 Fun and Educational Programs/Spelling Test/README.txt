SPELLING TEST

This program can help you improve your spelling.  The computer will
give you a word.  It will spell the word the way it sounds but not
necessarily the way it is really spelled.  You must then type in the
correct spelling.  For example:

  COMPUTER:   Spell REECEEV
  YOU ENTER:  RECEIVE

If you spell the word incorrectly, the computer will give you the
correct spelling.  After the last word, the computer will tell you how
many words you got right.

The spelling words are contained in the DATA statements, and may
easily be changed.
