HORSE RACE

In this game, you start with $500.  You then bet all or part of It on
one of four horses: A, B, C, or D.  If your horse wins, the amount of
your bet is added to the $500.  If your horse loses, the amount of
your bet is subtracted from $500.  Any time that you have money left,
you can bet all or part of it on the next race.  The object is to get
to $1000 before you lose all your money.

The horses move randomly so that each race is different.  Have fun and
good luck.
