DICE ANALYSIS

Use this program to improve your understanding of dice.  When you roll
a pair of dice, there are more combinations that add up to the number
7 than there are of any other number.  The next highest number of
combinations add up to 6 and 8, then to 5 and 9, etc.

You can prove this to yourself by rolling a pair of dice and recording
the results.  It is easier, however, to simulate this process by using
this program.  Just type RUN, hit ENTER, and tell the program how many
times you want to "roll" the dice.  The program will calculate and
display the number of times that each possible sum occurs.

While the program is simulating the results, the message, "PLEASE
WAIT", will appear on the screen.  The greater the number of rolls,
the longer the waiting time will be, but the better the results will
be.
