COMPUTER PIANO

Now, it's time to bring out the musical genius within you.  RUN this
program and your computer will become a musical instrument.  If you
hit the A-key, it will play an A note.  Likewise, the B-key will play
a B note, and so on for notes A through G.

The sharp notes are played as follows:

    Note    Press Key 
   A sharp      H 
   C sharp      I
   D sharp      J
   F sharp      K
   G sharp      L

Eventually you will want to compose your own music.  But meanwhile, to
