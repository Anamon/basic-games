SORTING BATTING AVERAGES

Who are the best ranking hitters on your team?  This program makes it
easy to find out.  For each player, enter the name, number of times he
came to bat, and the number of hits.  After the last player to be
ranked, enter 0,0,0 so that the program knows the list is complete.

The program will then compute the batting average of each player.
After this, it will rank and display all the averages, listing from
highest to lowest.
