RANDOM NUMBERS

  A program to help you understand random numbers

The purpose of this program is to help you understand how random
numbers are generated and how they work.  In this example, we will
limit ourselves to generating only three numbers: 1, 2, or 3.  Since
these numbers are being generated randomly, it is pure luck or chance
as to whether we will get a 1, 2, or 3.  For example, if we generate
300 numbers, we should get about the same number of 1s, 2s, and 3s (in
this case, 100 ones, 100 twos, and 100 threes).

Try it.  Start with 100 numbers.  Then, try 200, 300, and 400 numbers.
The amount of ones, twos, and threes should be close, if not exactly
the same.  In fact, the more numbers you generate, the more equal
should be the amount of ones, twos, and threes that you get, but it
will take longer to get the answer.

While the numbers are being generated, the message, "PLEASE WAIT, I'M
THINKING", will appear on the screen.
