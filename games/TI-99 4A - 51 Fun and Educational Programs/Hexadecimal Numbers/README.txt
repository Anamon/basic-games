HEXADECIMAL NUMBERS

  A program to help you understand hexadecimal numbers

Hexadecimal numbers are a little more complicated than binary numbers,
but they are just as important for a thorough understanding of how
computers work.  This program should help you get such an
understanding, by letting you experiment with the changing of
hexadecimal numbers into decimal numbers.

Whereas binary numbers use a base of 2, hexadecimal numbers use a base
of 16.  Many computer books deal with the hexadecimal numbering
system, so if you are not familiar with it, it is suggested that you
obtain such a book and review the subject first.

When you first run this program, start by inputting the suggested
hexadecimal number FF (which is equal to 255 in decimal).  Then, try
some other hexadecimal numbers, such as A2, C5, F5, etc.  The computer
will show you how each hex number is converted into a decimal number.
