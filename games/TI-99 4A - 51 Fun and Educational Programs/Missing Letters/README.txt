MISSING LETTERS

In this word recognition game, the computer will give you a word that
has two of the letters missing.  For example:

    M-L-IPLY

Your task is to figure out the missing letters which, in this case,
are "G" and "T".  Type in "G" and "T" (remember to insert the comma
between the letters).

If you guess correctly, you earn 10 points.  If your guess is wrong,
you get two more chances.  If you still can't get the answer after
three tries, the computer will give you another word.  The objective
is to get as high a score as possible.  At the end of the game, the
computer will tell you your final score.

Words and their missing letters are stored in the DATA statements, and
may easily be changed.  The last DATA statement must be END,X,X.
