BOMB

The object of this game is to find a bomb before it blows up.  The
bomb has been placed in a room, at a hotel which has 100 rooms.

A bomb detector will help you find the one room with the bomb.  As you
check each room, the detector will give you a reading.  The closer you
are to the room with the bomb, the higher the reading. When you move
away from the room with the bomb, the reading will become lower.

You have just 90 seconds to find the bomb.  It "costs" you 10 seconds
to check a room.  Since you only have time to check nine rooms, you
must make clever use of your detector.

Hint: If you constantly have difficulty with the 90-second time limit,
you can increase the time limit by changing line number 110.  Change
T=90 to T=120, or some other time limit that you may prefer.
