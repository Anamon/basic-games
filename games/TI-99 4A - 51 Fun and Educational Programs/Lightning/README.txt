LIGHTNING

  How far away is the lightning? 

Have you ever been in a thunderstorm and noticed the number of seconds
that pass from the time you see the lightning and hear the resulting
thunder?  This difference in time can tell you approximately how far
away the lightning is.  That's because you see the light almost
instantly, whereas the sound travels much more slowly.

Use this program to set up a table of distances for every second from
one to twenty (1, 2, 3, ..., 20 seconds).  Then, the next time you are
in a thunderstorm, note the time between the lightning and thunder and
use your table to find the distance between you and the lightning.
