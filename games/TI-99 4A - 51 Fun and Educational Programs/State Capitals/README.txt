STATE CAPITALS

Here is a fun way to learn and memorize the capitals of our fifty
states.

The computer will randomly pick ten state capitals.  Your job is to
name the state whose capital is shown on the screen.  At the end, the
computer will tell you how many capitals you named correctly and will
give your percentage score.

Since the states are picked randomly, the order of the state capitals
should be different each time you run the program.
