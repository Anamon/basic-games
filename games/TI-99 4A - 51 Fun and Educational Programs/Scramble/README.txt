SCRAMBLE

In Scramble, the computer gives you English words, but with all the
letters mixed up.  Your job is to guess what the correct word is.

The game is scored so that you get 10 points for each correct answer,
and you lose 10 points for each wrong answer.  If you don't know the
correct word, hit ENTER.  The computer will move on to the next word
after subtracting 10 points from your score.

The words are scrambled randomly.  This means that no two games will
play exactly alike, even with the same words.  After several games,
you may wish to change the words contained in the DATA statements.
This is easy to do.  However, just make sure that the last word is
END, so that the program knows when your list is complete.
