JOYSTICK CRAYON

Here is your chance to be a computer artist.  This program makes it
possible for you to draw pictures on the screen with one of your
joysticks.

Just follow these easy steps:

  1. Make sure ALPHA LOCK (in the lower left-hand corner of your
     keyboard) is in the UP position.

  2. RUN the program.  A tiny black square should appear on the
     screen.

  3. Test both joysticks to see which one moves the tiny black square.
     Use this joystick.

  4. Move the joystick in the direction you wish to draw.

  5. To move the black square without drawing a line or to erase an
     existing line, hold down the FIRE button (red button on
     joystick).  With this button down, moving the black square over
     an existing line will erase that part of the line.

If you don't have joysticks, use the Keyboard Crayon program given
next.
