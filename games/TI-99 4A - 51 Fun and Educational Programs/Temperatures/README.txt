TEMPERATURES

This program will help you gain a better understanding of the Celsius
temperature scale, which is used in the metric system.  It does this
in two ways:

  1. It shows you a table of equivalent temperatures in both the
     Fahrenheit scale and the Celsius scale.

  2. It provides an easy way for you to convert from Fahrenheit to
     Celsius.  Just enter any Fahrenheit temperature and the computer
     will give you the equivalent Celsius temperature.
