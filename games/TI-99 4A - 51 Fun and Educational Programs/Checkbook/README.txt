CHECKBOOK

  Let the computer balance your checkbook 

Here is a useful program that will help you balance your family
checking account.  To understand how it works, RUN the program using
the following example:

    STARTING BALANCE = $500
    DEPOSITS = $200

The computer will show that:

    SUM OF CHECKS = $434.39
    NEW BALANCE = $265.61

The outstanding checks are contained in the DATA statements.  Each
DATA statement contains the check number and the dollar amount of the
check.  To use this program for your own checking account, replace the
example checks given in the program with your own outstanding checks.

After you have changed the DATA statements to list your own checks,
save the program for use in the following month.
