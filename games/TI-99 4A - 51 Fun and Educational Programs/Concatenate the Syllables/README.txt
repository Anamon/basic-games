CONCATENATE THE SYLLABLES

  Con-Cat-E-Nation 

Concatenation means "linking" or "putting together."  This program
illustrates concatenation by letting you create words from a group of
letters and syllables.

RON the program.  You will see nine letters and syllables.  How many
words can you create from these?  For instance, to make the word
"STAND," concatenate letter number 8, letter number 5, and syllable
number 7.  Enter these as a single number, 857.

You can easily change the nine letters and syllables given in the
program by replacing them with other characters in the DATA
statements.  Up to nine letters or syllables may be used and they must
be followed by the word END.
