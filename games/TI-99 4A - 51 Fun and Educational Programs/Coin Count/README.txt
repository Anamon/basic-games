COIN COUNT

Here is a good way to teach a child the value of money or, more
specifically, the value of coins.

The computer will tell the child how many coins it has in its "pocket"
(the number of halves, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies).  The
child is asked to figure out the value of all these coins.  If his
answer is correct, this amount is added to the child's total.  If the
answer is wrong, the correct amount is subtracted from the child's
total.  The total, however, does not drop below zero.

The objective is for the child to reach a total of $10.00.
