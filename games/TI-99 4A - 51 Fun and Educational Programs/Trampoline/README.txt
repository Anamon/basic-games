TRAMPOLINE

Trampoline is a very interesting program in two ways.  First, it is a
simple guessing game that pre-school children will find fun and
educational, especially those that are just learning how to count.
Secondly, it is very interesting from the programming point of view,
for it uses special characters to develop a cartoon-like action that
shows a man jumping up and down on a trampoline.

Programming Note â€”- The special characters are created by the CALL
CHAR statements given in lines 190-210.  The CALL CHAR statement in
line 220 creates the trampoline.  The images of the man in various
jumping positions are contained in the array called "X" (defined by
the DIM statement of line 110).
