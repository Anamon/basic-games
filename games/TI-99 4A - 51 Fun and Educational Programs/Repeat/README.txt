REPEAT

Use this game to develop and test your memory.

A one-digit number will flash on the screen.  Try to memorize it and
enter it on the keyboard.  If you are correct, a second digit will be
added to the previous digit, and the new two-digit number will be
displayed for you to enter as before.  This process will continue
until you are able to correctly repeat a 10-digit number.  If you are
able to do this, you will win the game.

Any time you miss entering the correct number, it will be repeated for
you.  Miss it again and it will be repeated once more.  But miss the
number three times in a row and you automatically lose.  Good luck.
