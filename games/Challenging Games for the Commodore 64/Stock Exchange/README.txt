STOCK EXCHANGE

Your Commodore 64 will now give you a chance to make a fortune on the
stock market.  Unfortunately if you manage to make a million dollars
you will find it very difficult to spend because your computer only
plays with computer dollars which can’t be spent outside the program.
The good news is, of course, that if you go bankrupt playing this game
the computer can’t make you pay off your debts.

You begin the game with a limited amount of money and you have to
manage this money carefully, buying and selling shares, to set
yourself up as a successful investor.

The computer will display a balance sheet on the screen.  This will
show you the status of four companies, how many shares you hold in
each company, the price per share, the price you paid for the shares
if you hold any and the net profit or loss on your investment.  The
headings for these columns are provided by lines 160 and 170.  Type
these lines in exactly as they are shown in the listing, including the
spaces.

If you attempt to sell shares you do not hold the computer will charge
you with FRAUD.  If you try to spend more money than you have you will
be declared bankrupt.

As in real life, your whole share portfolio can be rendered worthless
by a sudden collapse in the share market.
