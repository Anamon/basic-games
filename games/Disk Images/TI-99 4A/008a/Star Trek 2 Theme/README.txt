STAR TREK 2 THEME

This is a rendition of the theme to Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan,
together with some actual digitized graphics from the movie.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "008a.dsk/TREK2A" and "TREK2B".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC and is credited to Ken Gilliland of
Glendale, CA, but no further information is known.
