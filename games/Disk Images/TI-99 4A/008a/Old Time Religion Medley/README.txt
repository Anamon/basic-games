THE OLD TIME RELIGION MEDLEY

This is a medley of religious tunes, including (I presume) "Old Time
Religion", but I don't recognize that melody.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "008a.dsk/OLD-TIME".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC, and was credited to Bill Knecht, but
no further information is known.
