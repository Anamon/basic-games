SNOOPY CHRISTMAS

This program provides a nice graphic of Snoopy decorating a Christmas
tree while Christmas music plays.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "008a.dsk/SNOOPY".

The game is in TI BASIC and is credited to Bill Christensen of Moraga,
CA, but no further information is known.
