STAR TREK THEME 2

This is another rendition of the Star Trek theme song, coupled with
some graphics and the original lyrics.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "008a.dsk/STARTHEME1".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC and is credited to Ken Gilliland of
Glendale, CA, but no further information is known.
