ELECTRONIC CHRISTMAS CARD

This is the same as C. Regena's original "Merry Christmas" program,
except it was modified to run in Extended BASIC by Tim Tesch.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "008a.dsk/CHRISTMAS".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC, and is credited to C. Regena in
1983, with further revisions in 1986 by Tim Tesch, but no further
information is known.
