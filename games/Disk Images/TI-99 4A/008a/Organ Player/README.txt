ORGAN PLAYER

This is a organ simulation that provides a small selection of
different instruments.  However, it includes no sharps or flats, so
you're stuck with C Major and A Minor.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "008a.dsk/PIPE-ORGAN".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC and is credited to Sam Moore, Jr.,
but no further information is known.
