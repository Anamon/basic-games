AXEL F

This is a rendition of Harold Faltermeyer's "Axel F" theme from
Beverly Hills Cop.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "008a.dsk/AXELF".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC, and is credited to Robert J. Gagle
in 1985, with further revisions in 1986 by Jim Reiss, but no further
information is known.
