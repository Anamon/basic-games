SOLITAIRE

Solitaire is an implementation of standard Klondike solitaire.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0014.dsk/CLAS-SOL"

The game is in TI Extended BASIC and written by Don Crossman in 1983.
This is labeled as being a "99'er version", but the program refers to
itself as being the "User's Group Edition".
