SPEAK AND SPELL

This is a TI BASIC version of the Speak and Spell software, directly
from Texas Instruments.

That said, I've not been able to get this to work yet.  It requires a
disk system (to load external files "PHRASES" and "WORDS"), uses CALL
SAY (which is an XB feature), and redefines characters past code 143
(which is not an XB feature).

I strongly suspect that the solution is to use it with the Speech
Editor cartridge, but I don't have the image at hand.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0098.dsk/SPEAKSPELL".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC, and is credited in 1981 to Texas
Instruments, but no further information is known.
