SOME GUYS LIKE BEER

This is a platform game similar to "Burger Time", and is possibly also
called "Drunkman".

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0096.dsk/DRUNKMAN".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC, and is credited in 1984 to Marcello
Zannini, with 1988 revisions by Barry Gibbins, but no further
information is known.
