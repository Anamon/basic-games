BILLY BALL TO THE RESCUE

This is a platform game somewhat akin to Pitfall.  Move to the right
and jump over the colorful obstacles, but watch your timing.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0096.dsk/B/RESCUE".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC, and is credited to R. Trueman,
but no further information is known.
