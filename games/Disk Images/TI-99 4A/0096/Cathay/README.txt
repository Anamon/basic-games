CATHAY

In this adventure game, you are "Chu Hsi and have 128 days to rescue
Princess Xhi Khi from the outlaws".  You proceed by moving from space
to space on a grid of encounter squares -- and, if you're like me,
dying pretty quickly.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0096.dsk/2850".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC, and is credited to Barry Gibbins of
Merlin Programs, but no further information is known.
