BILLY BALL AT THE HATCHERY

This is a somewhat impenetrable platform game.  The object appears to
use the hammers to free the little slime creatures from the boxes, or
something like that.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0096.dsk/B/HATCHERY".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC, and is credited to R. Trueman,
but no further information is known.
