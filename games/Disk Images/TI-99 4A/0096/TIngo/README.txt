TINGO

This is a Bingo system for the TI that prints out a collection of
Bingo cards (except that they're "TIngo" cards) and then serves the
caller -- including speech.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0096.dsk/TINGO".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC, and is credited to Steve Karasek,
but no further information is known.
