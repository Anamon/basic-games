FLOORAWAY (KEYBOARD)

This is a Lode Runner-like platform game, but with the twist of floors
that disintegrate when walked over.  This version of the game uses
keyboard controls; a joystick version is available separately.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0096.dsk/FLOORAWAYK".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC, and is credited to R. Trueman, but
no further information is known.
