2ND FLOOR

This is a sequel to the same author's "Flooraway" Lode Runner-like
platformer that features a greater variety of hazards and obstacles.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0096.dsk/FLOOR2".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC, and is credited to R. Trueman, but
no further information is known.
