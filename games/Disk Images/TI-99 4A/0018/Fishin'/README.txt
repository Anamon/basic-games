Basic, which allows fewer characters to be redefined.]

FISHIN'

Fishin' is simply a pleasant animated graphics display.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0018.dsk/FISHIN'".

The game is in TI BASIC, but no further information is known.
