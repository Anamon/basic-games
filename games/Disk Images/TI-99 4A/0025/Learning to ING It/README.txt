LEARNING TO "ING" IT

Learning to "ING" It is an education game about forming the -ING form
of verbs.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0025.dsk/LEARN_ING".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC and apparently written in 1987 by
Tigercub Software, but no further information is known.
