FORMATION

In "Formation", you use the S and D keys to move left and right to
avoid the oncoming airplanes.  Be warned that there is inertia!

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0025.dsk/FORMATION".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC and by Jim Peterson, but no further
information is known.
