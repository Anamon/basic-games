HOW MANY FROGS?

How Many Frogs? presents mathmematical story problems involving ratios.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0025.dsk/HOWMANY".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC and is *likely* by Jim Peterson
(purely from context), but no further information is known.
