THE '37' GAME

The '37' game is yet another "Nim"-like game involving trying to drive
the total to exactly 37 without going over.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0025.dsk/37GAME".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC and apparently by Jim Peterson, but
no further information is known.
