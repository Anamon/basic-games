NOUN TO ADJECTIVE

Noun to Adjective is an educational lesson in forming the adjective
form of nouns.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0025.dsk/NOUN/ADJ".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC and apparently by Tigercub Software,
but no further information is known.
