BLADE RUNNER 2020

Contrary to the name, this game is more of a "shooting gallery",
involving firing at some flying saucers and not others.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0078.dsk/BLADERUN".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC, but no further information is known.
