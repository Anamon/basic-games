ROAD WARRIOR

This is a top-down driving game that seems a bit like "Spyhunter".
You don't seem to have any weapons, but I might be mistaken.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "005f.dsk/!PIRANHA".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC and credited in 1987 to Howard Uman
of Randallstown, MD, but no further information is known.
