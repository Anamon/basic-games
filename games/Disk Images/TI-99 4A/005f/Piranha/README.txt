PIRANHA

This game casts you as a fish? or perhaps a submarine?  Well, it looks
like a fish, but you shoot things that are purportedly torpedoes.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "005f.dsk/!PIRANHA".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC and credited in 1985 to Howard Uman
of Randallstown, MD, but no further information is known.
