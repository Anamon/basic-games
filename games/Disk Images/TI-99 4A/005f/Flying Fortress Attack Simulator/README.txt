FLYING FORTRESS ATTACK SIMULATOR

This is a simulation of bombing runs with multiple stages, including
the initial takeoff and an aerial dogfighting sequence.  (Pretty
impressive for Extended BASIC!)

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "005f.dsk/!FORTRESS".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC and credited in 1986 to Howard Uman
of Randallstown, MD, but no further information is known.
