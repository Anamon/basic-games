[Note: This game requires TI BASIC and will not run in TI Extended
Basic, which allows fewer characters to be redefined.]

MERRY CHRISTMAS

This is an animated musical Christmas card.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0040.dsk/XMASCOMPUT".

The game is in TI BASIC and apparently written by C. Regena from
Compute! Magazine, given the logo present in the program, but no
further information is known.
