MARILYN MONROE

This program includes music, a quiz, and graphics about Marilyn Monroe
(yes, including pixelated nudity if you complete the quiz
successfully).

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0040.dsk/MARILYN" and
"0040.dsk/MM".

The game is in TI Extended BASIC, with graphics credited to Walter
Moore and music to Stephen Foster, but no further information is
known.
