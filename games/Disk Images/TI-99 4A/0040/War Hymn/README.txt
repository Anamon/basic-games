WAR HYMN

This is a rendition of music that is presumably called "War Hymn", but
isn't familiar to me, so that's simply a guess based on the filename.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0040.dsk/WAR/HYMN".

The game is in TI BASIC, but no further information is known.
