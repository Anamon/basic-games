BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC

This is a rendition of the Battle Hymn of the Republic, coupled with a
flag graphic from "Spirit of '99" (apparently from 1984-01).

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0040.dsk/BATTLE".

The game is in TI BASIC and credited to Earl Dodd, but no further
information is known.
