LARRY'S TEN FIDDLE TUNES

This is a collection of traditional fiddle songs:

  Soldier's Joy
  Arkansas Traveller
  Cincinnati Hornpipe
  Pop Goes the Weasel

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The game is in TI BASIC, credited in 1984 to Larry Schott, and was
apparently published in Home Computer Magazine, but no further
information is known.
