OH! SUSANNA

"Oh! Susanna" is a "bouncing ball" rendition of the classic folk tune
with accompanying graphics.

This game was found in a collection of old TI disk images.

The original image name and path was "0040.dsk/0'SUSANNA".

The game is in TI BASIC and by Sherri Kennedy, but no further
information is known.
