Binary

This game tests your skills in binary-to-decimal and decimal-to-binary
conversion.  You are given twenty conversion trials.  Numbers are
choosen randomly and your score is printed at the end.  The answer to
any conversion you miss is displayed; if the next conversion is
presented, you may assume you got the previous correct.

There are several possible modifications for this program such as
timing the response, allowing the user to specify the number range,
checking for duplicate numbers, or extending it to other bases.

This program was written by Ted Park of Pacific Union College.  It
originally appeared in Creative Computing, Mar/Apr 1975.
