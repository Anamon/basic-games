Two-to-Ten is a game of chance played with a special deck of cards
with only the cards 2-10.  The game is similar to blackjack in that
you are drawing cards and trying to come as close as possible to a
goal number (chosen at random before each round) without going over
it.  You must come within a certain number of points of the goal
number determined by a "lucky-limit" card.  The catch to the game is
that you are not given the exact values of the goal number but rather
a clue that is only within 15% of the goal.

Can you think of a way to make Two-to-Ten more interesting?  Perhaps
playing it against the computer as an opponent?

Two-to-Ten appeared in Creative Computing, Nov/Dec 1976.
