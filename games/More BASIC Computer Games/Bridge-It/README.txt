Bridge-it is a two-player pencil and paper logic game.  One player is
represented by X's, the other by O's.  The X's and O's are arranged in
an alternating grid pattern so that X's may be joined to one another
by a line without crossing an O and O's may be joined to one another
without crossing an X.  The object of the game is for the X's to draw
a line from the top to the bottom of the board.  The O's must connect
a continuous chain from the right to the left of the board.  Players
move alternately and may go any place on the grid.  Any two or your
symbols, either X's or O's, may be connected together on a given move.

In this particular version of the game, the computer is your opponent.
The computer plays the X's and you play the O's.  The computer moves
first, wshich gives it a very slight advantage.  If you find it is too
formidable an opponent you may wish to modify the program to allow the
player to move first.  At any point during the game you may ask for a
printout of the board and see how the play is progressing.

This program was written by Michael Kass, Miles Barel, and Alan Segal.
