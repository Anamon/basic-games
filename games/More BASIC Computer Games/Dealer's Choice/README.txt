This game is based on the TV quiz/chance show, Dealer's Choice.  You,
the player, are given $100 to start with.  You then play five card
games loosely modeled on casino gambling games but with variations
peculiar to the TV game making it, hopefully, more interesting to the
TV audience.  The five games are well-explained in the rules.

This game was written by Thomas Carey.
