"Gramma Nomad" is a person who doesn't really know where she wants to
live, so she moves to a new house every game.  Then she sends you a
telegram asking you to visit her.  The object of the game is to
successfully navigate your way through the streets of Garbonzo City to
Gramma's house.  See the game for more details.  A map of Garbonzo
City is provided for your reference.

Nomad was written by Steve Trapp and first appeared in Creative
Computing, Sep/Oct 1977.
