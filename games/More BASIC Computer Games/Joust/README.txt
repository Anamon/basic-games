In this program you are a medieval knight in a jousting tournament.
The prize to the winner of the tournament is the princess' hand in
marriage.  To win you must beat four other knights, the gold knight,
the silver knight, the red knight, and the fierce black knight.  On
each pass of your opponent you must select one of eight different
aiming points, such as the helm, lower left, face of shield, et
cetera, and, based on your aiming point, you may select from three to
six different defense positions such as a right lean or shield low.

As you proceeed in the jousting tournament there are different
intermediate outcomes such as getting knocked on the shield, breaking
a spear, and so on.  There are also some outcomes which end the
contest such as your getting killed, or getting knocked from your
horse.

This program was conceived and written by Alan Yarbrough.
