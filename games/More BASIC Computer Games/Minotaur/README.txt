In this game, you are in a three level cavern.  Inside the cavern are
ten pillars which stretch through all three levels; they're
electrified so that if you touch them you are immediately vaporized.
Furthermore, there are trap doors which appear randomly and drop you
down own level.  The top level is three, the second level down is two,
the first or lowest level is one.  If a trap door appears in level one
you are dropped into a bottomless pit and that ends the game.  The
minotaur itself also poses a hazard.  If you wound him with your
spear, he will charge you.  Also, he randomly charges for no reason at
all.  However, he only charges in a straight line.  Hint: keep at a
slight diagonal from the minotaur until you are ready to throw your
spear at him and you have a better chance of avoiding his charges.  If
you ask for a map, the axes are drawn in with X's.  This does not
indicate a barrier or fence; you are free to move across the X and Y
coordinate planes.  However, you are advised not to move out of any of
the four edges as this represents yet a different form of bottomless
pit and also ends the game.  There are many, many additional hazard
which are not shown in the sample run.  Try it, and be surprised!

This program was conceived and written by Pete Klausler.
