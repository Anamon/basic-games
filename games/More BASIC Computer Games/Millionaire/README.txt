In this game, the computer takes you through your life from birth to
death.  Along the way, you're asked to make some petty and some other
rather crucial decisions.  Some of these decisions regard what kind of
job you want, how much you bet in Las Vegas, whether you buy a
valuable coin, whether you elect to take a vacation or a second jobs,
stock purchases -- buying and selling, automobile accidents,
tornadoes, and the like.

At the end of your life (it goes by in a flash!) the computer tallies
up your gains and your losses and tells you where you stand relative
to becoming a millionaire.  In ten plays of the game, the most we ever
got was $379,000, somewhat short of being a millionaire, but probably,
all things considered, more realistic.

Millionaire was conceived and written by Craig Gunnett, a dreamer to
the very end.
