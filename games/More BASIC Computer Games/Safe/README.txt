In a sense, this is another game in the "guess a mystery number"
family.  However, it has quite a different "twist."  In this game, you
are trying to open a safe by turning or twisting a dial back and forth
between one and ninety-nine or ninety-nine and one.

The instructions shown in the sample run are very complete.  However,
one hint that will help you when you start playing is that it is
usually best to start at ninety-nine when going to the right because
if you get a click, the number must be close.  If not, you can step it
down by eight or tens until you get the first click and then judge
from there.

NOTE: There is no spot 0 (zero) and it spins back past the last number
      automatically as in most locks.
