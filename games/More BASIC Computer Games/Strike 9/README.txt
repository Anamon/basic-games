This is a simple game based on the numbers 1 through 9, and a pair of
dice.  First, the computer rolls a random number for your "dice."
Then you must take that number from the total of your board numbers
1-9.  To win you must remove all of your board numbers.  With each
roll you must remove the total number of that roll from the board or
you lose.

One strategy is to remove the largest numbers possible with each roll,
or you can try to get the most numbers removed.  For example, if the
roll is 10, you might want to remove the 1, 2, 3 and 4 instead of the
1 and 9.

You may want to have competition and players can alterate with rolls.
Then the player who can't remove all numbers from his/her roll loses.

Strike 9 was conceived by Bruce Grembowski and first appeared in
Creative Computing, Jan/Feb 1977.
