In this game you are in a pit with a man-eating rabbit.  The center of
the pit, appropriately enough, is at 0,0, and it has a radius of ten.
On each move, you can move in any one of eight different angles, 0,
45, 90, 135 ... etc.  Unlike you, the rabbit can take more than one
hop on a move.  The object of the game is to avoid the rabbit for ten
moves.  If you do this successfully you'll be released and set free.

We're not sure what race of people on what planet dreamed up this
diabolical sport, but we've found that it's extremely difficult to get
away from the rabbit it more than about one out of ten games.  You
may, therefore, want to improve the odds somewhat by limiting the
number of moves the rabbit can make on each turn to one or two.
You'll find it interesting to graph the results of the program as you
go along.  To do this, you'll need a piece of quadrille paper at least
21 squares in each direction.  Draw a circle with your compass ten
units in diameter and then number the grid from minus ten to plus ten
along the X and Y axes.  Plot your moves as you go along and you'll
see some interesting patterns develop.

This program was conceived and written by Philip Stanway.
