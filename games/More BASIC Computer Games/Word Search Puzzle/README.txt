This program generates the immensely popular word-search puzzles
containing names of Presidents, states, types of animals, fish, and
every manner of objects.  It asks you the length and width of the
puzzle you wish generated and then the number of words to be hidden in
the puzzle.  As the instructions note, occasionally the computer may
find that it can't hide a particular word in the puzzle and will ask
you if it should start over or it you want that particular word
deleted.  If you start over, try giving it fewer words or larger
puzzle dimensions.  The program hides the words fairly efficiently
although you can usually improve on it slightly when you get the final
puzzle out.  Since you're probably just using this program for fun,
it's generally more than adequate.

This word search puzzle generator was originated by Leor Zolman.
