CHASE puts you in a maze made up of high-voltage fences and posyts.
This in itself isn't too unpleasant but there're also the five
interceptor robots bent on just one thing--your destruction.  If these
robots touch you ... that's the end of the game (and you!).  There's
one hope--make the robots hits the maze, or each other (they're like
people--sometimes they'd rather be alone).  If you destroy them all,
you win!  If you find yourself in a totally hopeless situation, you
have the option of making a tremendous leap to a random location
(which may well be on top of a fence or a guard).

At the end of the game, you may replay with the same or different
starting conditions.

I believe this game was originally created by Mac Oglesby.  It was
then modified by Bill Cotter and further improved by Arnold Loveridge.
An intermediate version appeared in Creative Computing, Jan/Feb 1976.
