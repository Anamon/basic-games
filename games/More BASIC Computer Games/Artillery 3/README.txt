Artillery 3

In this game, two or three humans may play.  Each one of them has an
artillery piece and is firing at an opponent.  The first person to
destroy his opponent wins that round of the game.  The parameters for
distances and muzzle velocities of the artillery pieces are set at the
beginning of the game.  The shots are fired by giving a firing angle
expressed in degrees from the horizontal.

In a three player game, you may elect which player you are firing at;
hence, player one and three could both be firing at player two.  Once
one of the players is eliminated, then it becomes a two player game
and each of the remaining two players fires at each other.

Personally, I would prefer to think of this game as lobbing mudpies or
snowballs or custard cream pies or something non-destructive.
However, it was originally written as shoot-'em-up game so that's how
it appears here.

This game was originally written by Mike Forman and further revised by
N.E. Lyon and Brian West.  It first appeared in Creative Computing,
Jan/Feb 1976.
