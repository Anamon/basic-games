Jumping balls is a solitaire board game played with a board having
nine holes in a line that can be filled with four white balls to the
right end and four black balls to the left end.  Without a board, it
can be played with coins or chips.  The object of the game is to
reverse the position of the balls (or other objeects) from one end of
the board to the other.

You may make a move by moving a ball to the immediately adjacent empty
hole or by jumping one other ball.  You may not jump two or more
balls.  Holes are numbered from left to right.  At the beginning of
the game, hole number five is free.  Consequently, a legitimate first
move would be six to five, four to five, three to five, which would be
a jump, or seven to five, another jump.

The computer does not rank your playing ability but, as a hint, you
ought to be able to complete the game in fewer moves than are shown in
our example run.

The original author if this game was Anthony Rizzolo.
