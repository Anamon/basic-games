This program is a life-expectancy test derived from Peter Passell's
book "How To."  The test asks you a series of questions dealing with
your life-style and environment.  At the end of the questioning, the
program gives your estimated life-expectancy and the percentage of the
population you should outlive.

You may wish to experiment with certain variables to see what effect
they will have on your lifespan.  It's unlikely that you want to
change your sex, but you may wish to check out the effect of smoking,
drinking, mental attitude or weight.

This program was written by John E. Rogers.
