The program Countdown is based on the program Guess in which the
computer chooses a random number and then gives you clues whether you
are too high or too low until you finally get the number.  In
Countdown, the program adds a little interest to this guessing game by
giving you a certain number of tries to get the mystery number between
one and ten before your schoolbuilding explodes.  Using a good
guessing strategy should allow you to get any number in four or fewer
tries.  If you take more than four tries, the building goes "boom."
To add a little more interest to the game, you may want to make the
maximum number of tries three.  To do this change the value of T in
statement 45 from 4 to 3.
