Camel

In this game of high adventure, your object is to travel 200 miles
across the great Gobi Desert.  You're being chased by a tribe of
knock-kneed pygmies.  You have one quart of water which will last you
for six drinks; it may be renewed if you find an oasis or, if you are
found by another traveller, you may get an additional half-quart of
water.  During your journey you encounter all types of hazards such as
sand storms, wild Berbers and possible injuries to your camel.

Warning: this is a very hazardous and addictive game.  It is also very
difficult to win.  In ten plays of the game, the maximum distance we
were able to travel was 159 miles, and in many cases we managed to
make only seven or eight miles before one of the hazards caused our
demise.
