Seemingly, the purpose of this game is to chase-down and catch a
rabbit.  Now this rabbit is an elusive little devil -- it can hope
randomly in any direction.  You can run at least as fast as the
rabbit, maybe even faster (the computer will decide).  You must get
within 20 units of the rabbit to be able to catch him.  Before each
hop, the computer will print out your position, the rabbit's position,
the direction the rabbit is going to jump, and your closest approach
on the last hop.  You are to tell the computer which direction you
wish to run.  All coordinates and directions are as a geometer would
mark them on a standard Cartesian Coordinate System.

In addition to being good fun, this game gives you practice in using
and visualizing an x-y coordinate plane.  After each hop, consider the
output and try to run the right direction.  Try to do all the figuring
in your head.  Using scratch paper is considered to be cheating
(except for maybe the first time you play).

Suggested Modifications

1. Change the program so that you can choose your own speed.

2. The game is much more challenging when the "capture distance" can
   be varied.  A distance of 50 units is a cinch, 15 units may make
   you wish for scratch paper, 5 units will require you to use a
   protractor and graph paper.

3. See if you can invent a way to extend this game to 3 dimensions! 4
   dimensions! etc.!

4. You might try limiting the total number of hops and/or having the
   computer give hints when requested.
