This is a card game for up to four players, or three players plus the
computer.  A deck of 32 cards s used with ace through eight in each of
the four suit.  All 32 of the cards are dealt out at the beginning of
the game, eight to each player.  On each hand, each player discards
one card depending on the rules of the game (see the rules at the
beginning of the sample game) either the high card dicard or the low
card discard wins that trick After eight tricks a new hand is dealt
and play proceeds as before.  Perhaps the easiest way to learn Octrix
is to play a few games with you and the computer or with several
people and the computer.  Observe what happens and before long you'll
be able to work out a reasonable strategy for playing the game.
