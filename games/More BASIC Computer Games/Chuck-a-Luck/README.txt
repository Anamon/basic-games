Chuck-a-luck is generally found in fairgrounds, cheap casinos, and
small gambling parlors.  It flourished in frontier America, but dates
back to European gaming houses of the eighteenth century.  During its
long history, chuck-a-luck has had many names including sweatcloth,
chucker-luck, chuck luck, and bird cage.

Each player places his bets on one of the six numbers, one through
six.  When all bets have been placed, the operator tumbles three dice
in a chuck cage until they come to rest face up or drop down a chute
onto the table.  If a player's number appears on one die, the operator
pays him even money; if on two dice, two to one; if on three dice,
three to one.

The computer version of Chuck-a-luck was originally written by Michael
Tanoff.
