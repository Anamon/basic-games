This program loosely simulates a debate with your father about going
out on Saturday night.  After you win or lose the debate, then
Saturday night approaches and you must decide whether or not to
actually go out.  When all is said and done, the computer will give
you a score on a scale of minus seven to plus four.  (This could have
been a scale or zero to ten, but computers have this magic ability to
give us scales of anything we want).

This program originated in the dungeons of Digital Equipment
Corporation and was whipped into its present form by Victor Nahigian.
