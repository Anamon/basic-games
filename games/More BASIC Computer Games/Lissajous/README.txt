This program prints Lissajous patterns.  You enter relative X and Y
frequencies and the Y phase of pi.  The relative frequencies for X and
Y must be a positive number one or greater.  The phase may be between
zero and any number of you want.

We have experimented with a wide range of relative frequencies and
phases and come up with some startlingly beautiful patterns.  Some are
starkly plain while other are amazingly complex.  If the frequencies
go much beyond nine or ten, the patterns generally become jumbled and
difficult to decipher particularly if they are being printed out on
the normal hard copy terminal.  Nevertheless, it's fun to experiment.

This program was originally written by Larry Ruane and modified by
several other people along the line.  It appeared first in Creative
Computing, Sep/Oct 1977.
