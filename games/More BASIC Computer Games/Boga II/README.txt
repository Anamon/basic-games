Boga

A Boga is a bogus animal or mythical beast in the Hurkle family.
Like a Hurkle, the Boga hides on a grid with dimensions up to 20 by
20.  It sends out clues that tell you which direction to movbe from
where you are to where it is.  However, one major difference between a
Boga and a Hurkle is the Boga is also seeking you out at the same time
you are looking for it.  You don't have to tell it which directions to
go after each of its guesses to get closer to you.  It apparently has
a very good nose and can tell on its own.  However, it plays fairly
and gives you the first guess, and then it takes its guess.  Guesses
continue alternately until one or the other, human or boga, find the
opposing player.  At the beginning of the game, you may print out the
grid if you wish to make your guessing job slightly easier.  Remember,
directions in this game correspond to the diagram; that is, north is
up and east is to the right.

This game was created by David Strickler.
