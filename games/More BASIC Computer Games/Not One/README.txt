The game, Not One, sometimes known as Pig, is played with two players
and a pair of dice.  There are ten rounds in the game; one round
consisting of one turn for each player.  Players add the score that
they attain on each round and the player with the highest score after
ten rounds is the winner.

On each turn, the player may roll the two dice from one to as many
times as he wishes.  If the total of the dice on any roll after the
first equals the total shown on the first roll, his score is then zero
for that entire turn and the dice pass to the other player.  On the
other hand, if the total on his dice is anything different from the
total on the first turn, he continues to roll and adds the totals of
the dice to his score.  After each successful roll, the player can
decide whether to roll again or stop and score the number of points
already obtained.

You'll find that the computer plays a surprisingly good game of Not
One.  To beat it, you'll need some knowledge of probabilities and a
litte bit of luck on your side.

Not One was written in response to a challenge that appeared in the
charter issue of Creative Computing.  The game was written by Robert
Puopolo and first appeared in Creative Computing, Mar/Apr 1975.
