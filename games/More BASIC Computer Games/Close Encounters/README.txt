In this game, you are situated at the center of a target area for a
UFO.  The program assigns coordinates 0,0 to your location.  You are
given information as to the course of the UFO in degrees longitude and
degrees latitude and also its speed.  You then have two alternatives.
One, you can attempty to shoot the UFO out of the sky with an ICBM or
you can do nothing and hope that air friction will cause the course of
the UFO to deviate or to burn up.

A knowledge of mathematical coordinate systems will be of some
assistance in winning this game, although you'll probably be able to
discover a reasonably good strategy by yourself using trial and error
if you play enough games.

This program was originally written by Chris Falco.
