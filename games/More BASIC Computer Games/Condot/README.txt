This is the old childhood favorite of "connect the dots."  The
objective is to carve out squares of "real estate" with the computer
as an able adversary.  The player who connects the two dots which
complete a square gets ownership of that square.  In addition, the
player gets the added bonus of moving once more.  This can be quite
advantageous in certain situations.  A nine-square grid is provided as
a playing board.

A sample of the grid follows with an identification of each coordinate
where a line may be drawn.

      (1,2)       (1,4)       (1,6)
      
(2,1)       (2,3)       (2,5)       (2,7)

      (3,2)       (3,4)       (3,6)
      
(4,1)       (4,3)       (4,5)       (4,7)

      (5,2)       (5,4)       (5,6)
      
(6,1)       (6,3)       (6,5)       (6,7)

      (7,2)       (7,4)       (7,6)

You'll find it interesting to note that the computer mirrors the
player's move in so far as possible.  You may also find that the game
moves rather slowly, especially for the first three or four moves.  Be
patient!  Once squares begin to fall, the game moves swiftly on its
conclusion.

There are some modifications that you may wish to consider if you are
going to adopt this program for regular use.  In addition to improving
the REM statements in the program, I would suggest:

1. Modifying the program so that the grid is printed after *both*
   players have moved (rather than each time a move is made);

2. Modifying the program so that once a player had ownership of a
   majority of squares, the game would end rather that proceed to its
   inevitable conclusion; and

3. Modify the program so that the player's initials appear in each
   square he captures.

The program is by Chuck Lund; the writeup by Pete Olivieri.  It
originally appeared in Creative Computing, Jan/Feb 1976.
