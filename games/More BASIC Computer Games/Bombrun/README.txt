Bomb Run is an extremely accurate simulation of an aircraft dropping a
bomb on a very small target.  You may specify whether the aircraft is
climbing, diving, and the angle in degrees.  You may specify speed in
feet per second; you may also specify at what point you wish to drop
the bomb.  The program gives you four passes over the target.

A perfect hit is possible but extremely difficult to achieve.  A hit
within 300 feet of the target is considered "threatening" while hits
outside of that range may be considered a negative commentary on your
knowledge of physics.

This program was originally written by Jim Prelesnik.
