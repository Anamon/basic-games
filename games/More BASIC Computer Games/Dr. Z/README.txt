Using DR.Z your computer "interacts" with you in true Rogerian form,
never making a value judgment of your response.

DR.Z is multi-lingual and "professional confidence" is guaranteed,
especially with a video display terminal.  However, if you have a
print, try employing a unique language known only to you and Dr.Z.

If you would prefer to emply DR.Z in an educational mode, you might
consider the following sequence of activities.

1. Discuss communication, exploring:
   a. The role of spoken language
   b. The role of written language
   c. Non-verbal language
      1. facial expressions
      2. posture of the body
      3. hand gestures
2. Experience a session with DR.Z.
3. Develop computerizations of other "purely human" situations.

Note: Don't mistake DR.Z for Eliza (or Doctor).  In DR.Z, all the
response are "canned" and the computer makes no attempt to analyze
your input in any way.

DR.Z was submitted to us anonymously by some students of Dr. Melvin
Zeddies of San Diego.
