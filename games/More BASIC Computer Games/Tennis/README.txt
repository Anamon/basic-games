Tennis is, as its name implies, a tennis match.  In this game you have
several options available to you as the position on the court that you
wish to play from, the placement of your shot that you're trying for,
and the speed or type of shot.  As in normal tennis, you don't always
make the shot that you try for.  The program lets you play, more or
less, at the intermediate level.  If you think that it allows you to
play too well or too poorly, you could always change some of the
random factors that determine how often a shot is missed.
