DRAG Allowws the user to design his own dragster and then race it
against a dragster designed by another player or the computer.  You
must specify the horsepower, rear end ratio, tire width, and tire
diameter.  There are no limits to these parameters.

Aha! you say.  "I'll just design a two million horsepower dragster!"
But it doesn't work that way, because your mass is related to your
engine size, and so you usually end up with a top speed of something
like 33 MPH.  The computer is extremely hard to beat, but it's rumored
that it can be done.  Note: on some systems the amount of time between
printouts can be aggravatingly long.

This program came from the Hewlett-Packard User Library.  It also
appeared in Creative Computing, Jan/Feb 1977.
