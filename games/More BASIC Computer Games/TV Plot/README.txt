This program automatically devises plots for television shows or
series guaranteed to appeal to the masses and win high Nielsen
ratings.  By substituting appropriate words in the various parts of
the program it could be easily modified for many other useful purposes
such as devising names for new breakfast cereals, preparing PhD
theses, or naming government agencies and their corresponding
projects.

This program was originally written in FOCAL by Mary Cole and
converted to BASIC by David Ahl.
