Bobstones

The idea for this number game was derived from a contest called
"Bobstones" described in the novel Watership Down.  The object of
Bobstones is to guess three things about the roll of a pair of dice.

1. If the sum of the dice is odd or even . . . . . 1 point
2. The sum of the dice . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 points
3. The number on each of the two dice  . . . . . . 3 points

The winner is the first player to score eleven points.  If a tie
results, the winner is the first player to break the tie.

In the computer version of the game, you are playing against the
computer.  However, the computer makes its guess before the dice are
"rolled."  Hence, it has no real advantage over its human opponent.

This game was written by Dohn Addleman.  It originally appeared in
Creative Computing Mar/Apr 1976.
