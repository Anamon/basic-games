DEEPSPCE is another version of a space battle.  You become the
commander of either a scout ship, cruiser, or battleship.  You then
pick the weapons, and planetary system to patrol, and it's time to do
battle.

The closer you get to the enemy, the better your chance of destroying
him.  Unfortunately, his chance of destroying you also improves.  If
you get too close, you can damage yourself; when a vessel's damage
rating reaches or exceeds 100, it's destroyed.

Suggestion: Change the time between reports -- this will shorten the
game by allowing you to get closer faster.

Deepspace originally appeared in Creative Computing, Mar/Apr 1976.
