Baccarat (Chemin de Fer)

Games of the baccarat and chemin de fer family originated in baccarat
that became popular in the French casinos in the 1830's.  In the
present century they have travelled from Europe to the United States,
back to Europe, and to casinos throughout the world.  This process has
resulted in wide variations in playing rules and what is called
"baccarat" in one casino may more nearly resemble the "chemin de fer"
of another.

The computer game here is more nearly chemin de fer than it is
baccarat.  The rules, briefly, are as follows: Eight packs of cards
are shuffled together and placed in a "shoe" from which the cards can
be slid out one by one.  Following this, the players make their bets.
Any player may make any bet up to the amount of the bank.  The player
at the banker's right has the first choice to bet.  Any part of the
bank he does not take may be bet by the next player on his right, and
so on in order until the entire bank is covered or until everyone has
bet who wishes to.  Any player may take the entire bank by saying,
"Banco," but when two or more players wish to banco, the one nearest
the banker's right has the privilege.

After the bets are placed, the banker deals two hands of two cards
each, dealing one card at a time.  The hand he deals first represents
all the player betting against him; the other hand is the banker's.
The player who has made the largest bet against the banker plays the
opposition hand.

The object of the game is to hold two or three cards which count nine
(9), or as nearly nine as possible.  The values of the cards are: face
cards and tens, zero; aces, one each; and other card, it's number.
Units of ten points are disregarded, so that nine plus seven count as
six, not sixteen.

A player whose card in nine or eight in his first two cards shows his
hand immediately.  He has a natural and his hand wins (but a natural
nine beats a natural eight).  Naturals of the same number tie, and
there is a new deal.

When the result is not decided by a natural, the banker must give a
card to his opponent on request; or the opponent may stand.  The
opponent must stand on six or seven, must draw to a zero, one, two,
three, or four, but has the option on five.  The additional card, if
given, is face up.

Then the banker decides whether to stand or take a card.

IF BANKER GIVES   BANKER STANDS ON   BANKER DRAWS TO
Face card or ten  4, 5, 6, 7         3, 2, 1, 0
Nine              4, 5, 6, 7 (or 3)  2, 1, 0 (or 3)
Eight             3, 4, 5, 6, 7      2, 1, 0
Seven or six      7                  6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
Five or four      6, 7               5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
Three or two      5, 6, 7            4, 3, 2, 1, 0
Ace               4, 5, 6, 7         3, 2, 1, 0
Opponent stands   6, 7               5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0

Neither player may have more than one additional card, giving him
three cards at the most.  When each player has exercised his option,
the cards are shown.  If the totals are the same, the bets are off and
may be withdrawn and new bets are placed exactly as before for another
deal.  If the opponent has a higher number than the banker's, each
player collects such portion of the bank as he has covered.

In the game of chemin de fer, the role of banker rotates among the
players after each hand; in baccarat, it does not.
