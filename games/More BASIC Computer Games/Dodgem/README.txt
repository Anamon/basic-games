DODGEM is a game originally devised in 1972 by Colin Vout, then a
student at the University of Cambridge, England.  It got its major
publicity from Martin Gardner who discussed it in the June 1975 issue
of Scientific American.  Complete instructions are in the sample run.

It may be played by two players in which case the computer is the
referee, or by one player against the computer.  The computer,
incidentally, plays uncommonly well.  This is not surprising since
Dodgem was written by the very talented and prolific Mac Oglesby.
