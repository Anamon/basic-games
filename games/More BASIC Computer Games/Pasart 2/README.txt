This program is a major extension of the original Pasart program.  It
incorporates many new options including printing a calendar for any
year from 1600 to 2300.  It allows a user to enter any desired pair of
printing characters.  The size of the output is expanded to 72 by 72
with an option to expand it further by dividing the final triangle
into 72 by 72 chunks that may be taped together.  Another option
provides the user with the opportunity to create a picture based on
four Pascal's tables (option 6).

There wasn't room to show the output from all of these options on
these pages.  Try them out yourself and we're sure you'll be pleased
with the rather spectacular results.  Pasart 2 was also written by
Charles H. Lund.
