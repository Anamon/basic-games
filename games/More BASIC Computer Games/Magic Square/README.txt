We've all seen examples of magic squares.  The most common one is a
3x3 square using the integers 1 through 9 in which the sum of each
row, column and diagonial totals 15.

In the computer game of "Magic Square" the goal is to form a sum 15
magic square with you and the computer alternately filling in the
integers between 1 and 9.  If one player stumbles and puts a number in
which causes the sum of a row, column, or diagonal to be something
other than 15, he loses.

In forming a sum 15 magic square, there is only one fundamental
solution.  However, it can be rotated and reversed to form 8
solutions.  Because the computer does not play a particularly creative
game, all eight solutions cannot be obtained.  How many can be?

Can you modify the computer program to play a more interesting game
which permits all eight solutions?  (Hint: Try randomizing the move
position and number generators in Statements 400 and 410.)
