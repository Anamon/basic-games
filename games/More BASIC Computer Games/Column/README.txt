This program is a computer version of an old card trick which never
fails to get some ooohs and aaahs from the uninitiated.  The dealer,
ormagician, takes twenty-one random cards, deals them out in three
piles of seven cards each.  You then tell him which column (or which
pile) contains your card.  He then picks up the three columns from
right to left, putting the right pile on the top, and then deals the
deck out again horizontally.  In other words the top card of the right
column now becomes the top card of the left column; the second card in
the right column now becomes the first card in the middle column; the
third card of the right column becomes the first card in the third
column, and so on.  After he deals out all twenty-one cards in this
way, you again tell him which column your card appears in.  The
magician then picks up the three piles in the same order and deals
them out once again.  Again you tell him which column contains your
card.  He then deals the cards out one by one face up and identifies
yours when he comes to it.  Don't ask me how he does it!  Maybe you
can figure it out from the program, but it works every time.

This program was originally written by Alan Barnes.
