In this game, you are in an experimental building with one million
rooms in it.  The building is one hundred rooms long, one hundred
rooms wide, and one hundred rooms high.

You have just received a telephone call from a mad bomber who tells
you he has planted a bomb someplace in the building.  Fortunately you
are armed with a bomb detector that registers a stronger and stronger
signal as you get closer to the bomb.  You start at the bottom
right-hand door of the building, at the room 0,0,0.  In response to
the signals from your detector, every ten seconds you may try a new
room to search for the bomb.  You have two hundred seconds or twenty
trials to find it.

It's fairly easy to find the bomb once you get the knack of how your
detector works.  However, we're not going to spoil it for you and tell
the secret.
