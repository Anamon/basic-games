This program tests your knowledge of different types of musical
scales.  It generates 11 types of scales: major, natural minor,
harmonic minor, Hungarian minor, dorian, phygian, lydian, mixolydian,
locrain, and whole tone.

Prior to running the program, test yourself off line on a sheet of
paper by writing down several types of scales and 8 notes starting at
a note chosen by you.  Then run the program to check your answers.

When you run this program, you will be asked, "Which type of scale is
wanted?"  Respond by typing the first two letters of the name of the
desired scale followed immediately by the desired key.  Use a lower
case 'b' for the flat and use '#' for the sharp.  Sample inputs would
be phe for phrygian starting on E, maf# for major on F-sharp, and whg
for whole tone on G.

The author, Marvin S. Thostenson, is at the School of Music,
University of Iowa.  Scales first appeared in Creative Computing,
Mar/Apr 1977.
