In the this game, eight pegs are put in a row, each one of which can
hold eight rings.  Each ring is marked with either an X or an O.  You
and an opponent alternate turns; in this case the opponent is the
computer.  On each turn you place a ring over one of the pegs, one
through eight.  The object is to get four X's or O's in a row,
vertically, horizontally or diagonally.  A glance at the sample run
will show you how this process works.

While the computer already plays rather well, you may wish to
experiment with improving the computer's play by changing the values
in the data statements in lines 120 and 130.  The first four values
are awarded if a position yields one, two, three, or four in a row
respectively, for the computer.  The next four values are bonus points
for making one, two, three, or four in a row in more than one
direction with the same move.  The next eight values (line 130) are
dealt with in the same way for the human player; thus, these values
are for defense.

If you become addicted to this game, Milton Bradley markets it
commercially under the name "Connect Four."  The computer version of
the game was written by James L. Murphy.
