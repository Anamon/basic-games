This program, originally titled EVILK permits you to act out your
fantasies of being a motorcycle daredevil!  The game is a simple
motorcycle jump over several busses, which takeds into account both
gravity and drag forces.  The ramp angle and motorcycle speed
determine the distance jumped.  Note that the injury penalty is
greater for long jumps than for short ones, and that there is a chance
for a crash even on a jump of the right length.  This probability,
initially set at .20, can be modified in line 560 to make survival
more or less likely.

This program was written by Charles Aylworth and originally appeared
in Creative Computing, Jul/Aug 1978.
