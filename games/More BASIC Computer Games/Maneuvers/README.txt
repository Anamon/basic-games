In this game you are maneuvering in a corner of space shaped,
interestingly enough, like a cube.  The dimensions of the cube are ten
parsecs on a side.  The bases are at the corners as shown on the
diagram with the sample run.  There are four star bases located at
corners of the cube which you must visit in order, A, B, C, and D, to
deliver a message to them.  While it is a fairly simple matter to get
to Base A, the other bases sometimes prove somewhat elusive.  One
possibiliy would be to use a second computer to compute your course,
or even compute the course before you start the game and then feed it
in.  Would this be cheating?  I don't think so because the learning
value in writing a program to compute your course will teach you more
about the game than probably fifty plays of it.  On the other hand,
which is more fun?  That's for you to find out.

This program was written by John C. Russ.
