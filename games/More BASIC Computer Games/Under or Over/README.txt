This is a funny little dice game in which you're betting on the
outcome of rolling two dice.  You may bet on any number from two to
twelve.  If your number is exactly the same as shown on the sum of the
dice, you win at four to one odds.  If your number is under seven and
the roll of the dice is under seven, you win even money.  If your
number is over seven and the roll of the dice is over seven, you also
win even money.  Only a bet on seven itself can win at four to one.
The program goes on until you run out of money or until you interrupt
it.
