This is actually a two part game.  In the first part, the program
generates a maze which you can then try to find your way through with
pencil and paper.  Each path of the maze is three characters wide,
hence the maximum width that will print on a standard seventy-two
column width teletype or other hard copy printer is 24 for the
horizontal dimension.  A 132-column line printer could handle up to a
horizontal dimension of 44.  Naturally the vertical dimension can be
anything since it's running the length of the paper.  However, for
really large mazes your computer system will probably be the limiting
factor since several matrices are dimensioned with the horizontal and
vertical dimensions of the maze.

In the second part of the program a near-sighted mouse is let loose in
the maze and explores until he finds his way through.  If you want to
know what near-sighted means, run the program and ask to see the
solution step by step as the mouse goes through the maze.  If you
elect not to see each step, you'll simply get a total solution for the
maze itself.

With or without the mouse, it's a fun program and the larger mazes are
frequently a real challenge to solve.

This program was conceived and written by Richard Schaal.
