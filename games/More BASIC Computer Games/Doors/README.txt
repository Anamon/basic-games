In this cute little game, there are four doors in succession and you
must open them to get the prize behind the last one.  You have a key
ring containing eleven keys numbered zero to ten (computer people have
a different way of numbering things than normal people) and you have
fourteen tries to open all four doors.  As an added hooker, some keys
may open more than one door.  If at first you don't succeed, try, try
again.  The prizes behind the fourth door are well worth the patience
in trying to get them all open.

Doors was conceived and written by Bill Ingram.
