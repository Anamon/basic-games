In this program, you are attempting to complete one lap around a grand
prix circuit against one of six opponents, everything from a US Postal
delivery truck to a 1974 Ferrari.  The track consists of four
straightaways and four curves with different maximum speeds possible
for each one.  Depending on which car you select for your own, you can
take these curves and straights at different speeds.  Also, the car
you select will have different braking characteristics which may allow
you to head into a curve at a higher speed and then apply the brakes
at the last minute.

It may sound like it's easy to win by simply selecting a Porsche or
Ferrari for your car and racing against a US Mail truck or a well-used
Ford Mustang, but beware, it isn't really that easy.

The origin of this game is a bit hazy.  The only thing that identifies
it is PUC.  Could this be Pacific Union College?  Perhaps, but we're
not really sure.
