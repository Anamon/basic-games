Ready to try something new?  A game that isn't like STARTREK or Slot
Machine?  Then try MATPUZLE and enjoy the art of puzzle-making.

One benefit of puzzles is that they help develop a pattern of logic in
one's thinking.  In this puzzle you are given a matrix of letter, up
to 6 x 6, and a board with dashes and a number above each of the
dashes.

The matrix represents the letters of the words you typed in, each
having the same length.  The number of words and the length of the
words are both limited to six, six words each six letters in length,
but, both values don't have to be the same.  The letters are then put
in a matrix and randomly rearranged in lines 160-430.

The dashes on the board form the places for each letter of each word
to be written in after it has been deciphered.  The number above each
dash, determined in lines 500-780, is the sum of the coordinates of
where the letter of that dash is located in the matrix.  The problem
in solving the puzzle is that several coordinates have the same sum.

Since the answers appear above the puzzle itself, rip them off before
you give it to a friend to try.  They will a great time trying to
figure out your puzzle.  Then let them make one for you or set up a
relay.  The possibilities are almost endless.
