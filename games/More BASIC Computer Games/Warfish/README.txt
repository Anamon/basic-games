In this game, you're the commander of an American submarine with a
mission to seek out and destroy as many Japanese ships as possible
during World War II.

You may up your periscope to search for Japanese ships, you may launch
your torpedos, or you may dive to avoid Japanese ships that are
attacking you.

For the most part, this is a game of random probabilities.  To make it
more interesting, you might wish to introduce a skill factor in terms
of aiming your submarine or distance away from an enemy ship, size of
the enemy ship, and so on.
