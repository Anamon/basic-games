Keno is strictly an American invention that originated in the casinos
in Nevada, perhaps in Reno.  During the game, twenty numbers from one
to eighty are selected at random.  Prior to each game at the casino,
the player may choose from one to fifteen numbers, or "spots" he
thinks will be selected during the game.  The player enters, or
"marks," the desired spots and places a bet.  At the end of each game,
the spots marked by the player are compared with the twenty numbers
and the payoff is computed accordingly.  Keno seems to have a high
attraction in Las Vegas because the betting is very simple and the
maximum payoff is very high ($25,000).  Nevertheless, the probability
of winning is extremely low; indeed, Keno returns more to the house
than virtually any other game.

In this particular computersized version of Keno, therer is only one
player and he has the option only of betting eight different spots.
In Nevada the normal bet is in multiples of 60 cents; however, in this
game the bet will be $1.20 with no multiples possible.  The payoff
with eight spots marked is as follows:

    Spots       Payoff
      5           $10.00
      6          $100.00
      7        $2,200.00
      8       $25,000.00

There is no payoff for zero, one, two, three, or four correct.

This version of Keno was originally written by Vincent Fazio.
