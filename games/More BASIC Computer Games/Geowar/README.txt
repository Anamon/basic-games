This program very loosely represents a battlefield in which you, the
player, are located at point 0,0.  There are five enemy installationsd
that may be located anywhere from 0,0 to 30,30 except for a clear zone
from 0,0 to 10,10.  The accompanying diagram should make this clear.
Instead of the normal artillery type of game where you are lobbing
projectiles onto your enemy installations, in this game you are firing
some sort of laser missile in a very straight path which destroys
everything in its path.  If the missile flies within one unit either
northwest or southeast of the target, or, of course, over the target
direectly, that target is destroyed.  If it is within two units of the
target, the missile will be shotdown and that target will relocate to
a new position one unit away from its previous position in some random
direction.

Geowar is largely a guessing game in incomplete information given in
its clues.  Nevertheless it's fun to play and is a new switch from
just a plain guess the mystery number game.  It was written by Gary
Lorenc and originally appeared in Creative Computing May/Jun 1975.
