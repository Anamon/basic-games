This game is a one-lap jalopy race.  There is one big problem: you
don't know the shape of the course of the safe speed with which you
can go around the corners.  Consequently you're likely to smash up
faily frequently or else go so slowly that you don't earn a good
placing among the winners.  However, after four or five plays of the
game you'll begin to get the hang of it and you'll be able to whip
around the course in grand fashion.  The instructions in the program
are quite detailed.  Have fun!
