Cup is a cute little game in which a cup is located thirty lines down
the paper of your terminal or thirty lines down on your video display
screen a random number of spaces from one to sixty to the right of the
left margin.  The pull of gravity varies from one to ten lines per
second per second.  You are then asked in this program what push you
would like to give the ball from left to right across the paper in
spaces per second.  The program then traces the path of the ball from
the left margin of the paper as it falls down and hopefully into the
cup.

A knowledge of physics is helpful if you wish to get the ball in the
cup on the first try.  However, you can diddle with it by trial and
error and generally hit the cup on your fourth or fifth try.
