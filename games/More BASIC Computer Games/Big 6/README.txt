Big 6 is strictly an American invention from the casinos of Nevada.
There is a very large wheel mounted vertically, generally four feet or
more in diameter, that has the numbers one through six in a random
arrangement around its periphery.  Player place their bets on a
roulette type of table in front of the wheel.  The wheel is then spun
and three numbers are declared the winners.  There are the three
numbers that appear at the top of the wheel.  Most novice players
looking at the wheel think that since there are three winners they
have a very good chance of winning a large sum of money.  Betting
limits are generally up to $500 and, as many players discover very
quickly, the odds are very heavily in favor of the house.

If you feel that you must play Big 6, try it by computer first and
then figure out how much you can afford to lose when you go to play it
in Las Vegas or Atlantic City.  The comuter is a much better sport
when you lose than the casino managers will be at either of those
resort cities.

Big 6 was written by Steve Heywood and Dave Alvey.
