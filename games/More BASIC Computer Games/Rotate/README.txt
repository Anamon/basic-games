The game of Rotate is played on a four-by-four board filled randomly
with the letters A through P.  In a sense it is like the little
plastic games with sliding pieces bearing the numbers 1-15 or letters
A-O.

The object of the game is to put the letters in alphabetical order.
This is done by rotating groups of four letters clockwise one
position.  The group to be rotated is specified by the positional
number of the letter in the upper lefthand corner of the group.  You
are also given one special move which permits you to exchange any two
adjacent letters.  You probably don't want to use this move too early
in the game; indeed, sometimes it's not necessary at all, and since
you get it only one time, once you use it you can't recover.  Your
only move then is to type a zero to give up.

Typically, a game will take from 20 to 30 moves to win.  I haven't
figured out the worst possible case (assuming an intelligent method of
play); I'd be happy to hear from a reader on this.  Have fun!

Rotate was written by me, David Ahl, and first appeared in Creative
Computing, Sep/Oct 1977.
