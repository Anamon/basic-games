You are the driver of a race car on the notorious NY Route 20.  You'll
have to drive 5 miles with 1/2 gallon of gas, while keeping alert for
changes in the road conditions, other cars, etc.

At the start you pick your car and course.  During the race you
control braking and acceleration.

Watch out for passing another car!  If you try to go the same speed
he's going, you're going to meet a Greyhound bus head-on!

The game is tough to win.  I usually wipe out in a curve or run out of
gas.  You might want to increase your MPG rating... look at line 870.

Good luck!
