BIBLE QUIZ is a program which administers up to 25 questions about the
Bible to the user.  If the answer given to a question is correct, the
program proceeds to the next question.  If an incorrect answer is
given, the program gives the correct answer.  In either case, the
biblical reference is given.

Note that Statements 124 to 296 could serve as the basis for any type
of CAI dialogue with instructions proceeding Statement 124 and the
questions and answers in the data statements.

This program was written by Steve Wentworth of Muskingum College.  It
originally appeared in Creative Computing, Mar/Apr 1977.
