This is a naval war game player on a 10 by 10 grid.  You are a
submarine and the computer plays the role of the convoy consisting of
a cargo ship and two destroyers.  One destroyer acts as the escort
traveling alongside the cargo ship, while the other searches for the
submarine and tries to destroy it.  The destroyer which is searching
for the submarine moves from zero to three squares at a time,
searching.  The other destroyer stays within one square of the ship.
The submarine starts in square #12 and can move up, down, left, or
right one square at a time with two moves per turn.  It has four
torpedoes which may be fired one at a time in any straight direction,
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game ends when either the submarine destroys the cargo ship or
when one of the two destroyers gets the submarine.
