Schmoos are imaginary creatures who love being splattered with juicy
mudballs.  You, being a schmoo lover, try to make schmoos happy by
tossing mudballs at them.  It will help you in playing this game to
know a little bit about grids and angles like in the X,Y coordinate
system 2,-3 means right 2 and down 3.  If 0 degrees is the angle
coinciding with the positive X axis, then 2,-3 would be in the fourth
quadrant and would correspond to angles between 270 and 360 degrees.

If you're pretty good, you can "splat the schmoo" in about eight
tries; but don't cheat and use the formula.  And don't expect me to
tell you where it's hidden in the program!

If you want to extend the Schmoo game, you might want to add a third
dimension with flying schmoos.  The program shouldn't be too hard and
it would be a really neat game.  If you want to try something easier,
fix Schmoo so that it requires initial velocities as well as angles.
You could even make a low-gravity (lunar version) of Schmoo.

Schmoo was conceived and written by Frederick H. Bell at the
University of Pittsburgh.  It first appeared in Creative Computing,
Sep/Oct 1975.
