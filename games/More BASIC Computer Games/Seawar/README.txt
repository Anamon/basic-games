You are the commander of a fleet of ships operating in enemy
territory.  Your task force consists of 9 ships, and the enemy has 9
ships.  Whoever sinks all of the opponent's ships first wins the
campaign.

You, as the commander, must provide the angle of elevation at which
the guns will be fired, neglecting air resistance.  Your instruments
will read the range to the target, and the initial velocity is held
constant at about 675 meters per second.

SEAWAR will help you learn about the paths of projectiles and what
happens as the angle of elevation varies.

1. First, what do you think the path of the projectile looks like.
   Make a sketch.  (If you're still not sure, do some research in the
   library -- it will help you win the battle, commander!)

   a. What angle of elevation do you think will give the maximum
      range?

   b. What will happen if you fire the guns at 0 degrees?

   c. What will happen to the projectile if you fire it straight up?

2. After becoming proficient at winning the battle, change the initial
   velocity of the projectile.  How does this affect the range?

The original SEAWAR had a timing function that allowed only about 7
seconds to make your next move.  If your computer has a time, this
would be a neat addition.

The origin of SEAWAR is unknown.  It was revised and submitted to us
by David S. Paxton.  It was further revised and the writeup prepared
by Mary T. Dobbs, Mathematics and Science Center, Glen Allen,
Virginia.  It first appeared in Creative Computing, May/Jun 1975.
