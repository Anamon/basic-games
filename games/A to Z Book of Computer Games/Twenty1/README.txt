Twenty1

Nearly everyone has played this card game, which may be better known
by its other name, blackjack.  By either name, so too, has nearly
every programmer written at least one program to play it.  Most of us
have programmed it several times, several different ways, and perhaps
in different languages.  Here is yet another.

The first time that you do it the game's mechanics provide an
interesting programming challenge.  After that it is sometimes more of
a challenge to find something else challenging about it rather than
the rote mechanics of dealing the cards and tallying their worth.
That can become old hat in short order.

My enthusiasm for this iteration was finally rekindled by the
challenge of conceiving a new card-deck management scheme.  Which does
tend to prove that, no matter how tiring some problems seem, if we
ponder long enough, the fun of designing novel solutions to them can
still be had.
