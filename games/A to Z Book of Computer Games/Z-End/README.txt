Z-End

This is the end.  If you lisp a little it might even sound like Z-end.
A corny name, perhaps, but chosen because of a propensity for rounding
out our library with a simple classic.  The game is based on the
ancient game of nim.

The word nim is itself archaic, and means roughly to steal, filch, or
take away.  That is how this game called "Z-End" is played.  Players
take turns taking away letters of the alphabet.  The one that gets the
Z ends the game and is the loser.

Simple game.  Simple program.  Included because it is a classic, but
more importantly because it has a definite usefulness.

Need to demonstrate to a friend how easy it is to program?  This is a
good model.  It includes alphanumeric variables, conditional logic,
elementary arithmetic, DATA structures, and even FOR-NEXT loops.  Its
design is basically straight-line and therefore simple.  And it shows
in a rudimentary way how the computer is able to play a game.

This is also a good game for introducing new players to your computer.
Young and old alike will enjoy the ease with which they can learn to
play with your machine.  After a few rounds, and they move on to other
games, they will surely remember the fun they had in Z-End.
