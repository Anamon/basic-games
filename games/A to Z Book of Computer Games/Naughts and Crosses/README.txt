Naughts & Crosses

On the whole this book is meant to entertain.  But not without class.
Naughts & Crosses does seem more eloquent than tic-tac-toe.  Besides,
the letter T had already been committed.

By whatever name this game should be recognizable to children the
world over; and your own young friends will undoubtedly enjoy being
able to "beat a computer."  Most every youngster at about the third
grade or so knows the elementary strategies for this game.  That is
about the age at which they should have an advantage over the
educational level of this program.  Yet, it is amusing -- especially
to build it and to get it to work properly.

That is the true ambition of this example, anyway.  Here are the
mechanics and structures for programming tic-tac-toe games.  The more
adventuresome can go from here to devise more complex offensive
internals.  Some may even wish to go all the way and attempt a
three-dimensional version.  There is at least a foundation here for
such designs, as well as some academically interesting techniques.
