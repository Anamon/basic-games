Dice

Here is a game that is especially suited to computers.  In fact,
although this game can be played with paper and pencil, much of the
fun would soon dissipate because of the clerical tedium that is
involved if it is played that way.  Repetition and tedious arithmetic
are the forte of modern micros, however, and it's easy to presume they
are accurate and dispassionate as well.

The form of play is usual enough; two people taking turns rolling a
pair of dice, and the score per roll is the sum of the numbers rolled.
You are permitted multiple rolls per turn, and the score keeps
mounting; but there is a catch.  If a roll comes up as a match,
exactly, with a previous roll in the same turn, you forfeit the turn
and the score that was accumulating for that turn.  Of course, you may
relinquish your turn at any point voluntarily and receive credit for
your score to that point.

There is another pressure-cooker element also.  A game of Dice
consists of but twenty turns each.  The player with the highest score
after twenty complete rounds is the winner.

[Note: This game is very similar to "Not One" from "More BASIC
Computer Games", also in the collection.]
