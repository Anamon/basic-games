Verboten

Imagine a cosmopolitan computer.  Here is a chance to teach your
electronic companion a bit of German.  Although other languages could
be equally possible the German equivalent for forbidden quite nicely
fits our chapter-per-letter scheme.

This game is a derivative of the basic theme of players guessing a
hidden value that was chosen at random by the computer.  Its
construction is simple, yet the game has quite a lot more appeal than
the variety that has no more substance than to just pick a number.

Whether played by German kinder or children elsewhere, they all enjoy
the suspense that builds as they take turns picking letters of the
alphabet.  Eventually, in twenty-six or fewer turns, the alphabet will
run out.

Three things can happen with each turn. The player may get to keep his
or her chosen letter and score one more point.  Some one letter, when
picked, will declare a bonus and that player's score for the round
thus far will be doubled.  Some other letter is verboten.  The player
who gets the forbidden one loses his or her score instantly.  Another
round is started then, and the game goes on.

Presumably no lengthy argument is necessary to convince you to adopt
this program into your games library.  The few minutes required to
copy it could hardly be an excuse not to, and there is at least one
programming nicety within it.  And, it is fun to play.
