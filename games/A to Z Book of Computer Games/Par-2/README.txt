Par-2

This is another of those few games that have evolved as a direct
consequence of modern computer technology.  This one specifically is
attributable to the invention of the serial printer.  In other
languages, on a variety of systems, this game has also been known as
golf, minigolf, putt-putt, and perhaps others but the basis of each is
always the same.

The program prints an asterisk (the ball) and a zero (the hole) some
distance apart.  You simulate putting by guessing the number of print
spaces between the ball and the hole.  The program then moves the
ball, and counts your strokes.  With any luck at all (or if you have
calibrated eyeballs) you should hit the hole in two strokes.  Thus,
par is 2.

As programmed here, Par-2 optionally permits two, three, or four
players, and the course is a full eighteen holes.  Although it has
been done often on Teletype and similar printers this model was
developed on a CRT, which permits but thirty-two characters per line.
Which does prove that no matter what type of display you have, nor how
austere your computing budget may be, you too may adopt this
elementary but fun programmers' favorite.
