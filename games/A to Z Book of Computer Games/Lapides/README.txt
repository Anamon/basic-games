Lapides

Time again for a touch of class.  The name of the game is Latin for
rocks.  In the game there are forty-five rocks, and they are piled up
so that the bottom row has nine, the next row up has eight, the next
seven, and so on.

Two players compete in playing Lapides.  They take turns removing
rocks from the pile, working from the top down.  In a turn, a player
may remove as many rocks from the upper row as he or she likes, with
one stipulation: he or she must not specify the removal of more rocks
that the total remaining in the topmost row.  The object is to force
the other person to grab the last rock.

This is a fast game and one that is especially enjoyed by children.
The listing here has only 107 lines of programming, and this can
easily be reduced to less than a hundred if you omit the REM
statements.  Even if you are clumsy on the keyboard hardly an hour
should be required to load and debug this simple program.

Study of how the program is built and how it works should not take
long, either.  The program template in Fig. L-1 shows all of the parts
of the program and how they are conceptually connected.  A classic,
actually.
