Wampus

Have you ever seen a wampus?  "He's a big hairy creature that will
gobble you if he gets you."  So goes the story that introduces this
game.

The wampus lives in a cave.  You are lost in his cave trying to find
the only exit so that you can go home.  There are twenty chambers in
the cave and each has three passageways leading to other chambers.
One of the tunnels does go to the cave' mouth, and when you find it
you are free.

There are hazards.  In one chamber there is a deep pit.  If you
stumble into there you have had it. In three other chambers there are
bats.  You are afraid of bats, and when you encounter them you take
the nearest exit.  Normally you have time to ponder over which of the
three tunnels to take next.

When you wander into the wampus you have another choice.  He is afraid
of loud noises.  You have a six-shooter.  If you crawl into the
chamber where he is you can make a hasty exit; or if you fire the gun
he will take off to another chamber.  You are safe for the moment.
You don't know which tunnel he took, but neither does he know where
you will go next.  If ever you run out of ammunition and and happen to
run into the wampus again, he will eat you.

[Note: This is a derivative of the classic "Hunt the Wampus", several
other versions of which are in the collection.]
