ALPHABETIC HIGHWAY

This program again shows the power of working with sprites.  After the
RUN command has been entered you will see a busy highway with many
cars on it -- your task is to get across safely.  But that's not all.
If you watch carefully you will see the complete alphabet appear above
the highway.  It starts at A, progresses to B and so on.  You will
notice that your task becomes more and more difficult...

At the start of the game the computer requests a level which
determines the speed of the cars.  The cars do not all travel at the
same rate, however, and this makes your task all the more difficult.

If you are unlucky enough to be involved in an accident, the computer
asks:

    AGAIN (Y/N)?

and by pressing Y you are miraculously restored to health and the
games starts again.
