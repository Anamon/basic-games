ESCHER

The work of the Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher (1902-1972), based as
it is on symmetry and mathematical forms, appeals particularly to
computer programmers.

Now with the help of the computer you can produce your own patterns
based on the same principles as those used by Escher.

Consider the following pattern:

  [image with ambiguous foreground vs. background]

It is based on a mosaic in the Alhambra palace in Spain.  If you look
closely you can see that all the tiles are the same shape and that
they are arranged so that the 'inverse video' of the white tiles shows
the same pattern rotated through 90 degrees.  Escher studied such
patterns and invented a game based on them.  He devised a patterned
tile such as

  [image]

which he rotated through four positions

  [image] [rotated 90] [rotated 180] [rotated 270]

and arranged to form a continuous pattern.

This program does something very similar.  After you have filled a
'basic' square with symbols the computer rotates and shifts it to fill
the screen with your own 'Escher'.

At the start of the game the computer asks you to enter the size of
your basic square.  If you enter, for instance, 4, your basic square
will contain 4x4 elements.  Now you fill your square, row by row, with
the graphic symbols shown in lines 3000 to 3200 of the listing.  When
the square is filled the computer asks for the direction in which you
want the squares displayed.  You enter N, S, E, or W to indicate
north, south, east, or west.  The computer will ask you for as many
directions as it requires.

With this program you will be able to make an almost infinite number
of spectacular patterns!  Enter the program and see what you can come
up with.
