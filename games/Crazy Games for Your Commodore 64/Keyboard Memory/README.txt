KEYBOARD MEMORY

This game uses the computer keyboard to test your memory.  Eighteen of
the keys each conceal a number, in the same way that a playing card,
lying face down, hides its value.  There are nine different numbers,
each hidden by two keys.

The symbols of the keys you must concentrate on are shown on the
screen.

    Q W E R T Y
    A S D F G H
    Z X C V B N

Press a key and the number it is hiding will be shown on the screen:
press two, one after the other, and if they are both hiding the same
number their symbols will disappear from the screen.

Your first few attempts will obviously be guesses but by memorizing
the positions of the numbers they show, you should soon be able to
work out where the pairs are.

At the end of the game the computer will tell you what your
intellectual capabilities are.
