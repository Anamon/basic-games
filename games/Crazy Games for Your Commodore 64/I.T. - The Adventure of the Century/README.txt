I.T. - THE ADVENTURE OF THE CENTURY

In this crazy adventure you will sink into the bowels of the earth and
meet a very strange creature who lives there.  His name is, of course,
I.T. which stands for Intra Terrestrial.

If you have never played an adventure game before don't worry about
the rules -- there aren't any!  You have to work everything out for
yourself as you journey beneath the earth's surface, performing
extraordinary tasks and facing terrifying dangers as you go.  If it
all gets too much for you enter HELP and see what the computer comes
up with.

So, type in the game, take out a good insurance policy, give the RUN
command, and off you go!
