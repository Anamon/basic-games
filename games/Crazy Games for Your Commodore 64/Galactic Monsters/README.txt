GALACTIC MONSTERS

There it is, registering on the x-y-Gz radar.  At last, you are
approaching the Milky Way.  In just 2.56 protoseconds you will be safe
in your home galaxy!

But there is danger here, and as captain of your ship, you know very
well what it is.  You keep a watchful eye on the XR6-screen.  No alert
yet.  The tension is unbearable... 2.5 protoseconds... 2.0
protoseconds... 1.5 protoseconds... oh no!  There it is --

THE VAN ALLEN SQUARE STONE BELT

There are a number of these notorious belts, and in them lurk the
dreaded Galactic monsters.  No weapon can defend you against these
vengeful creatures; all you can do is avoid them.

Once the program is started and you see a VAN ALLEN SQUARE STONE BELT
then you can move yourself by pressing:

    W, for one square upwards
    A, for one square to the left
    D, for one square to the right
    X, for one square downwards

Those terrible Galactic monsters will approach closer and closer.
Your only hope for survival is to avoid them!  If you cross a VAN
ALLEN SQUARE STONE BELT a second time, the monsters will become more
aggressive.  Somehow, they seem to anticipate your every move.

Good luck, captain... only a few protoseconds to go, and you are home
free!
