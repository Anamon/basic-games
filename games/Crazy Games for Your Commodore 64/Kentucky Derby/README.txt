KENTUCKY DERBY

Ladies and gentlemen, they are off!  Red Arrow is off to a good
start...  Blondish Boy is giving his jockey some trouble... and
there's the famous Spanish Lady, on the inside track.  This is really
first class excitement, and we've only just begun!  Coming round the
first bend... Mickey Finn has taken over the lead, hard-pressed by
Speedy Gonzales...

The Kentucky Derby is a horse-racing game.  There are not as many
horses in our Kentucky Derby as there are in the real race -- in fact,
there are only three -- but they have to run 10 gruelling laps (with
computer horse-racing anything is possible)!  At the start of the game
the odds are given for each horse.  Now you can place your bets.  As
long as you have money you can bet again and again -- these horses
never get tired.

After the RUN command we see:

    YOU MAY BET NOW
    THE ODDS OF THE HORSES ARE
    HORSE 1: 10 to 1
    HORSE 2: 4 to 1
    HORSE 3: 20 to 1

(odds may vary from race to race).

    YOU STILL HAVE . . . DOLLARS
    YOUR BET ON HORSE 1 IS . . .

When you have run out of money, your computer cheekily tells you:

    YOU CANNOT SPEND THAT MUCH 

And if you are a little better off:

    YOU STILL HAVE . . . DOLLARS 

Immediately after you enter all your bets the screen displays the
racetrack, with horses at the starting gates.  The odds and bets are
displayed in the lower part of the screen and then you will see:

    START???

Press ENTER and they are off!
