STM

The nature of memory is certainly one of the most interesting topics
in psychology.  To remember something has been defined as 'to show in
present responses some signs of earlier learned responses.'  Why,
though, do we remember some things and forget others?  We may
recognize someone we haven't seen in years, or call to mind a tune
having heard only a few notes of it, but find it very difficult to
remember, for instance, a telephone number.  There are in fact two
distinct types of memory: short term memory (STM) and long term memory
(LTM).  If you want to find out more about this intriguing topic we
recommend that you read "Introduction to Psychology" by Hilgard &
Atkinson.

This game tests your short term memory.  Play it with your friends and
family and see who can remember most.  You will see this "menu" on the
screen:

    DO YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH
    1. LETTERS?
    2. NUMBERS?
    3. 0 OR 1 ONLY?
    4. OR DO YOU WANT TO STOP?

Now you make your choice by entering 1, 2, 3 or 4.  Say you entered 1
to play with letters.  A letter will now appear on the screen but only
for a very short time.  You have to enter that letter.  The computer
will then show you two letters which you have to enter, then three,
and so on.  Obviously, as the number of letters increases, remembering
them all becomes more difficult.  What is the longest string of
characters you can remember?  Can you beat our record of eight?
