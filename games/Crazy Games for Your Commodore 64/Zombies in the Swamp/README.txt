ZOMBIES IN THE SWAMP

Watch out!  There are zombies about, and you have to cross the swamp
where they live.  To do this you must walk across on rafts.

At the start of the game the swamp looks like this:

    WAY OUT 
       ^
     +-----------------+
     |                 |
     |      SWAMP      |
     |                #|
     +----------------^+
                here you are, 
                standing on a raft 

You are at one corner, and you must reach the diagonally opposite
comer to escape.  Use the appropriate cursor keys to position a raft
next to the one you are standing on, and again to step onto it.

So far so good, but beware!  From time to time one of those zombies
will emerge from the swamp and run across the rafts you have
positioned.  If you are in its way it will catch you.  Luckily,
zombies can't see very well so they often fall off the rafts back into
the swamp.

To succeed in this exciting game you must develop your own strategy.
The longer and more complicated your path the less likely the zombies
are to catch you, but, on the other hand, it will take you longer to
get across the swamp, giving time for more zombies to appear.

Oh no!  Here come those terrifying zombies again.  You had better just
hope they don't catch you.
