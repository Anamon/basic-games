VOWELS AND CONSONANTS

This competition game can be played by the whole family.  Unlike most
other computer games, it does not involve numbers or arithmetic.  At
the start of the game enter the number of players, and then take turns
to play.

The computer will give you seven letters: when it asks you

    V OR C? 

enter V for a vowel or C for a consonant.  When you have your seven
letters the computer challenges you to make as long a word as possible
out of them, using each letter once only.  There is a time limit,
shown on a clock on the screen.  It is amazing how addictive a simple
game like this can become.  Try it and see!
