One to Five 

This exasperating game, which we saw first on a CASIO calculator,
takes quite some logical reasoning to solve.  It is played on a board
with nine positions set out like this:

    1   2   3 

    4   5   6 

    7   8   9

A horizontal and a vertical line drawn through any one position will cross five 
positions in all.  For instance lines drawn through position 4 will also cross 
positions 1, 5, 6, and 7. 

    1   2   3 
    |
    4---5---6 
    |
    7   8   9 

The positions on the board are occupied by a random pattern of digits
between 0 and 5.  If you enter one of the positions (using the key
shown on the screen) the digit on that position, and all the digits on
the horizontal and vertical lines going through that position, are
increased by 1 (except 5 which becomes 0).  For instance if we had

    2 2 4
    1 5 2
    1 5 4

and entered 4, the board would change to

    3 2 4
    2 0 3
    2 5 4

The puzzle is solved when the board looks like this:

    0 0 0
    0 0 0
    0 0 0
