GENIUS AT WORK

Play this simple game to find out how good you are at thinking
mathematically.  In fact, get the whole family to play, and find out
which one is the genius!

The computer displays seven numbers and a larger "target" number.  You
must pick two of the numbers and one of the four simple mathematical
functions:

    addition        + 
    subtraction     - 
    multiplication  * 
    division        / 

The computer will then perform this calculation.  For instance, if you
enter 7 + 18 the computer calculates 7 + 18 = 25 and asks:

    DO YOU WANT TO KEEP IT THIS WAY? 

If you enter N the numbers 7 and 18 are replaced in the initial list
by 25.  Now you choose again. Your task is to get a final result as
near to the target number as you can.

The character of this game is simplicity, so the whole family can
play.  Now you can find out if there is a genius in your family.
