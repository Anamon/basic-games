ASTROLOGY

This program is based on a study made by the Dutch physicist and
astrologer Dr. Ir. J. Van Slooten.  He was a research worker at
Philips laboratories who spent all his free time on astrology.  He
developed a theory that the phase of the moon at the time of birth was
a very important astrological influence on a person's character.
After studying the lives of hundreds of people he concluded, "...that
the moon phase forecasts the extent to which the spiritual and
emotional life, especially with respect to a person's social
environment, will develop and furthermore the role he or she will play
in our society..."

The diagram shows the cycle of the moon's phases.  As there are three
phases, waxing, full, and waning, so three types of person can be
defined.

  Individualists: born in the waxing moon phase, they have waxing
    energy.  They like to work on their own, have strong wills, and
    are not discouraged by physical discomfort.

  Socialists: born in the full moon phase, they like to live in
    communities.  Key words for these people are "compare", "choose"
    and "combine".  Cooperation is a dominant factor but there is also
    rivalry and envy.

  Conservatives: born in the waning moon phase, they know that the
    light decreases but will return again.  They are careful and sure
    of themselves, and like to have everything under control.

These three types can be further subdivided to give twelve categories
in all:

  Pioneers are searchers, always ahead of the crowd.  Their strength
    of purpose can sometimes make them appear stubborn.

  Coordinators like to be with other people, but feel that they are
    "more equal" than their companions. They are romantic and strongly
    attracted to family life.

  Realists look at the world in a very down-to-earth manner.  They
    like to think that everything can be explained in purely physical
    terms.

  Spiritualists are rather "other worldly" characters.  Philosophical
    in outlook, they are seekers after the unknown.

  Artists transform material in a creative manner.  They can produce
    works of art, new products, or anything that did not exist before.

  Apostles are not themselves creative but spread the ideas of others
    to the world at large.

  Helpers take on responsibilities for their fellows that might
    otherwise be ignored.  They are helpful and caring to others.

  Leaders also assume responsibilities but in this case for directing
    the lives and actions of others.  They look forward where most
    people would prefer to look back.

  Knights are fearless adventurers, always searching for new things to
    explore.  Idealistic in outlook, they have a strong sense of
    honor.

  Arbiters like to preside over the actions of others.  They do not
    prejudge issues, but when they reach a decision they expect it to
    be obeyed.

  Revolutionaries are dissatisfied with the world as it is.  They tend
    to look on the bad side of things, and have a desire to change the
    world.

  Prophets consider the world "from above" bringing to bear the wisdom
    of the past.  They may not always be listened to, of course.

The program will tell you the phase of the moon on the day you were
born.  From this you can discover the secrets of your character!
