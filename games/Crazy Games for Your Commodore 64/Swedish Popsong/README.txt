THE SWEDISH POPSONG

A "thema con variatone" is a tune that, although it is based on one
that has been heard before, has its own mood and identity.  This game
could be considered as a thema con variatone as it has some
similarities with another game in this book, but presents its own
unique challenge to the solver.

You will see 16 fields filled with a random arrangement of As and Bs
e.g.

    B A B A
    A A A B
    A B A B
    B B A B

When you enter one of the fields (using the key shown on the screen)
all the letters on the horizontal and vertical rows through that field
will be altered so that all the As become Bs and vice versa.  Your aim
is to end up with a screen

    A B B A
    A B B A
    A B B A
    A B B A
