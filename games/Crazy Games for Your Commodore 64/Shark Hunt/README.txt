SHARK HUNT

For five days now you have been adrift in your boat searching the
seven seas.  Suddenly you see a slight ripple on the mirror-like
surface of the ocean -- there it is, your quarry, that terror of the
deep -- the shark.  You will be told at the start of the game how to
move your boat.  Your echo-sounder will tell you how close you are to
the shark -- the nearer you get the higher the note it gives.  Stray
too far from the shark and you are told

    SORRY; YOU WENT TOO FAR 

When you think you are close enough you can take a shot at the shark
by pressing the space bar.  If you hit the target you will see the
message

    THAT'S IT! CONGRATULATIONS! 

Unfortunately you only have 200 ergs of energy to use.  Moving your
boat and firing your gun both cost energy.  If you use up all your
energy the computer tells you

    YOU RAN OUT OF ENERGY 

At the end of the game you will be given information on your
performance as a shark hunter.
