EXPLOSION

Most computer versions of EXPLOSION set out the board for two or more
opponents to play on.  With this program you are pitted against the
computer itself.  Are you up to the challenge?

EXPLOSION is played on a board of 3 x 3 or 4 x 4 squares.  The
computer will ask you to enter the size of the board you want.

Each square on the board has a capacity equal to the number of squares 
directly adjoining it.  This means that corner squares have a capacity of 2

You and the computer have checkers, of opposite colors, that you place
on the board in turn.  You may place a checker on any empty square, or
on any square which already has one or more of your own checkers on
it.  A square will "explode" when the number of checkers it carries
reaches its capacity.  An exploding square empties, its checkers
spreading out, one to each neighboring square.  These checkers will
"take over" any opposing checkers on these squares.

As the game progresses the explosions get bigger and bigger.
Eventually the whole board will explode in one color.  If it's your
color you've won!
