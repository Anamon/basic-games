THE WOLF AND THE FIVE LITTLE GOATS

A Grimm's fairy tale?  No, an intriguing board game!  This game is
played on a checkerboard displayed on the screen.  As the game begins,
the goats are scattered throughout the lower half of the board and are
represented by little squares containing a number.  The wolf stands at
the upper left-hand corner of the board.

Off we go -- you are the wolf, and the computer controls the goats.
You win if you eat three goats, and the computer wins if one of the
goats eats you.  (These wolf-eating goats are amazing creatures!)

You may start.  On the lower part of the screen you see:

    YOU MAY ENTER . . . MOVES

for example 

    YOU MAY ENTER 2 MOVES

The number of moves always lies between 1 and 3, and tells you how
many steps you may take during your turn.  The wolf -- in other words,
you -- may move horizontally or vertically, but never diagonally.
Each move must be entered on the cursor keys.  If the last move of a
series of moves brings you on a square with a goat, the goat is yours.
You may never cross a square that has a goat on it.

There are 5 goats in all, and they may jump over each other.  Goats
can move only in one direction.  The number of steps they may move is
shown on the goats themselves, and is always between 1 and 5.  For
instance, if a goal bears the number 3 he can move

  3 steps to the left, or
  3 steps to the right, or
  3 steps forward, or
  3 steps backward

He cannot move 1 step forward and 2 steps to the left.  If you (the
wolf) have moved to a new position the computer shows

    NOW IT'S MY TURN

When it is your turn,  the computer shows

    YOU MAY ENTER . . . MOVES

At the end of the game the computer either tells you

    YOU WIN!

or worse

    YOU LOSE
