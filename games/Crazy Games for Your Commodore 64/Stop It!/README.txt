STOP IT!

Although this is only a short program it gives rise to a fast and
exciting game.  The screen looks like this

             |   |   |   |   |
             | A | B | C | D |
             |   |   |   |   |
    [A]-->   |   |   |   |   |
             |   |   |   |   |
             |   |   |   |   |

The square on the left has a letter on it.  When it moves across the
screen you must try and stop it, using the space bar, in the region
bearing the same letter.

At the start of the game the computer requests a level of difficulty
(1 is easiest, 2 is harder, and 3 is the most difficult) and asks how
many times you want to play.  You will be shown your score at the end,
for instance

    0 HITS OUT OF 10

Never mind, better luck next time!
