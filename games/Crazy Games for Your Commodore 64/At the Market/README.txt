AT THE MARKET

Have you ever wandered through a market and been amazed at the speed
with which the salesmen can add up a list of prices?  Play this game
with your family and find out how good a market trader you would make.

You will see pairs of numbers of increasing length which you have to
add up.  You will soon find out that this isnâ€™t as easy as it sounds.
To see why, consider the sum

      75856 
    + 37637 

Normally you would add the numbers in the right hand column first,
then the column next to it, and so on.  With the computer, however,
you must enter the answer starting with the left hand column.  It is
this difference that makes the game so tricky.

How many numbers can you add correctly within the time limit of about
one minute?  Can you beat our record of eight?
