NEW YORK, NEW YORK

This original and exciting game puts you in a helicopter high over New
York, looking down on the city's streets.  At the moment they are
deserted, but soon traffic will appear, and it's up to you to keep it
moving.  You do this by controlling the city's traffic lights.  When a
car (represented by a square) reaches a red light it will stop.  Each
traffic light bears a symbol -- pressing the key bearing that symbol
changes the light to green and the car will continue on its journey.

At the beginning of the game you have 100 points.  You gain 10 points
every time a car goes through a crossroads, and 25 points for every
car that gets right across the city.  However if two cars collide at a
crossroads you lose 100 points and the road is temporarily blocked.
If you run out of points the game ends -- if not it lasts about five
minutes.  The more points you get, the better traffic cop you are!
