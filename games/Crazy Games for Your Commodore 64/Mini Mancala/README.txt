MINI MANCALA

MINI MANCALA is based on an old Arabian game.  It is played by moving
stones between cups.  There are four cups: A and B are the computer's,
and C and D are yours.  At the start of the game there are two stones
in each cup.

         o o             o o
    A (computer)    B (computer)

         o o             o o
      C (you)         D (you) 

In turn, the players take the stones from one of their own cups and
distribute them counterclockwise to the other three cups.  For
instance you might choose to move the stones from cup D like this:

        o o o           o o o
    A (computer)    B (computer)

         o o
      C (you)         D (you) 

After this move cup D is empty.  In fact, there will always be at
least one empty cup, because during each move stones cannot be put
back into the cup from which they were taken.

To win the game you must get all the stones into your own cups.

On the computer, the cups are represented by squares with numbers on
them indicating the number of stones they contain.  You can choose the
level of difficulty you prefer, 1, 2, or 3 (1 being the easiest), and
who has the first move.  The computer will ask which of your squares
you wish to move the stones from and will tell you what its own move
is.  The position of the stones on the board is displayed after each
move.

You may be surprised that this complicated game can be described in
such a short program.  The diagram shows all the possible moves, and
is an excellent example of how a strategic game can be represented
schematically.
