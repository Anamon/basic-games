LAS VEGAS A GO GO

Have you ever watched someone pumping coin after coin into a one-armed
bandit, and found yourself wondering what the fascination was?  You
will soon find out when this program turns your computer into a
fabulous Las Vegas-style fruit machine.  All the playing instructions
you need will appear on the screen.  At certain points you will be
presented with a list of options, for instance

    INSERT, HOLD, PLAY, OR END 

Enter your choice by typing the first letter of the option you want,
for instance, P keeps your machine playing.  The reels are numbered 1,
2, and 3.  If you want to hold one or more reels, type in the
appropriate number or numbers after you have entered H.

Lights will flash and music play as the wheels whiz around.  Have you
won this time?  Never mind, you are sure to hit the jackpot
sooner... or later!
