FALLOUT

At the start of this simple but absorbing game you will see eight
horizontal bars with gaps in them.  Above the bars are eight checkers
which can fall through the gaps.  In this example

     1   3 4 5 6 7 8
    ###2## ### ### ##
    #  ###  # ### ###
    ##  ## #### ### #

checker 2 has already fallen into a gap.  The object of the game is to
get all eight checkers through the bars.  You can do this by moving
the bars to line up the gaps for the checkers to fall through.

To move a particular bar enter a command of the form

    BDS 

where

    B is the number of the bar (the bars are numbered from 1 at the
      top to 8 at the bottom)

    D is the direction you wish to move it (L for left, R for right)
      and

    S is the number of steps the bar has to be shifted.

For instance 

    3R12 

moves bar 3, 12 steps to the right.  This might sound like a very
simple game but when you actually start playing it you will find that
it provides quite a stiff test of your ability to think logically.
