SHIP'S ATTACK

First, let's describe this game as realistically as possible.  In the
lower half of the screen is a shape like this:

    ###    ###
      ######

Little squares fall down from the top of the screen.  You must move
the shape using the cursor controls and the shift key to stop the
squares hitting it.  If that sounds dull what about this...

You are captain of one of the finest spaceships in the universe.  As
you cruise majestically through the Milky Way you can't help feeling
proud of the magnificent vessel under your command.  Then just as you
are nearing base and the end of your voyage is in sight, disaster
strikes --

    A FLYING SAUCER ATTACK!

How can you escape these unfriendly invaders from across the universe?
Why not try your

    SUPER ATOMIC ESCAPE MOTOR?

The more flying saucers you avoid, the more points you get.  That
sounds better, doesn't it?  Anyway, the game is fast, simple and great
fun to play, and that is all that matters.
