SHAKESPEARIAN SHUFFLE

Shakespeare, one of the world's greatest writers, and chess, the king
of games, are combined in this unusual puzzle.

Letters are arranged on a chessboard like this:

    T O   B E   O R
    N O T   T O   B
    E   T H A T   I
    S   T H E   Q U
    E S T I O N
    W I L L I A M
    S H A K E S P E
    A R E   1 6 0 3

A chesspiece, the knight, then moves around the board as it would in a
normal game of chess.  As it jumps from one square to another, the
letters or symbols on the squares are exchanged.  In this way the text
on the board is jumbled up.  The computer will ask you

    LEVEL?

and you enter the number of moves you want the knight to make.
Obviously, the higher this number the more mixed up the board becomes.

You will be shown the board after the knight has made his moves.  Your
task is to unscramble the text by moving the knight back around the
board.  Enter a number between 1 and 8 to move the knight, as shown.

    . 1 . 2 .
    8 . . . 3
    . . K . .
    7 . . . 4
    . 6 . 5 .
