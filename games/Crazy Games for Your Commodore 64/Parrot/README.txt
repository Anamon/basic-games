PARROT

PARROT is a very simple competition game.  Play it on a rainy day with
a friend (especially after your friend has had a few beers!).

At the start of the game, your computer impertinently asks you:

    ARE YOU READY PARROT?

Yes, he is calling you a parrot!  Press any key and the computer
immediately displays a letter.  You must enter the same letter as fast
as you can.  Since you copy each letter, you really are a parrot!  The
game is repeated for about 10 seconds, and then the computer shows
your score.

How good are you as a parrot?  Have a competition with your friends
and try to win the title of 'Super-Duper Parrot'.  (My record is 19 --
I teach parrots!)
