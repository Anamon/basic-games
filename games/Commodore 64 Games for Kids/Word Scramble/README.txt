A Long Night and Tired Eyes

It's one of those nights.  There's a super triple feature on
television -- three monster movies, back-to-back.  You should do your
homework, but you just have to find out if the cockroach really does
eat Cincinnati.

By the time the third featvire ends, your eyes are almost shut You hit
the pillow and fall asleep in 43 seconds.  Two minutes later, you sit
straight up in bed.  Miss Zane, your English teacher, is yelling at
you in your mind.  You've just remembered the big exam tomorrow.  And
you spent the evening watching cockroaches dine on Cincinnati!

There's nothing to do but get out of bed and study for that exam.
Miss Zane is no easy teacher, and if you flunk the exam you'll be
grounded until four years from next Saturday.  But your eyes don't
seem to care.  Every time you try to read a word, your eyes play
tricks on you.  All the words are jumbled up.  If you don't unjumble
those words quickly, you're going to be in big trouble tomorrow
morning.

How to Play

"Word Scramble" is geared to three different skill levels.  Level 1 is
for beginners.  Level 2 contains words of five or six letters.  Level
3 contains words of seven to nine letters.  Press the number of the
level you want, then hit the RETURN key to start the game.

The computer will show you a word with its letters scrambled.  Type
the correct word on the computer keyboard and press the RETURN key to
enter it.  A correct answer will be rewarded with music and colored
lights.  An incorrect answer will be greeted with a buzz.  You can
guess as many times as you want, or you can skip a tough word by
pressing the f1 key.  If you press the f1 key, the computer will
unscramble the word and display the correct answer.  Unscramble as
many words as you can in the two-minute time limit.

Scoring 

You'll receive five points for each word you correctly unscramble.
One point will be deducted from your score for each incorrect guess.
There are 50 words in each level of difficulty, so the ideal high
score would be 250 points.  That total is very difficult to reach.
But if you're really good at Word Scramble, you'll pass Miss Zane's
test.
