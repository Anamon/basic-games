The Mighty Bee

If there's such a thing as a guardian angel of spelling, the spelling
bee is it.  As long as you're doing a good job at your spelling,
she'll stay around and watch you.  If you don't do well, though,
she'll lose strength and slowly disappear.  The object of "Spelling
Bee" is to guess the letters of words the bee gives you before she
disappears.  If you guess a word correctly, she'll return in all her
glory for the next one.

How to Play 

The computer will pick a word and tell you how many letters it
contains.  You must guess the word by selecting a letter at a time.
If you pick more than 11 incorrect letters, the spelling bee will
disappear.

To begin play, choose a skill level as listed below:

    1 = Beginner
    2 = Intermediate
    3 = Advanced

Press the appropriate number and the game begins.  A line of blank
spaces appears on the screen.  Each blank indicates a letter in the
word.  You should type a letter you think may be in the word.

When you type a letter, one of two things will happen.  If the letter
belongs in the word, it will appear in the right space.  If it does
not belong in the word, the bee will buzz, the screen will temporarily
go black, and the letter will appear on the bottom of the screen.
Each time you make an incorrect guess, a little bit of the spelling
bee will disappear.  If you guess 11 incorrect letters, the correct
word will appear.  But the spelling bee will be gone -- until the next
round.

Scoring

No point score is given in Spelling Bee.  Either the correct word is
guessed by the player, or it isn't.  At the end of a round, the
computer will ask if you want to play again.  If you indicate you do
not want to play again, the computer will tell you how many words were
guessed correctly. Then the computer will tell you how many words you
missed.
