The Algae Pit

You are an earthworm, arid you love eating algae.  The best algae in
the world are found in the algae pit.  Unfortunately for you, the
algae pit is owned by a person who doesn't like earthworms.  In order
to protect his precious supply of algae from you, he has sprinkled the
pit with pebbles and encircled it with an electric fence.  You got
inside the fence during a power outage, but now that the power is on,
you don't want to touch the fence.  Running into a pebble will cause
you indigestion.  Finally, you are so hungry for algae that you must
eat algae with every move you make, or you won't be able to go on.
This means you won't be able to backtrack over territory you've
covered before.  It isn't an easy task, but it's your life.

How to Play

You can choose one of five skill levels.  Level 1 is the easiest.
When the computer asks which skill level you prefer, the the number
you want and wait, joystick in hand, for the game to start.

As soon as "Earthworms" begins, the earthworm will begin moving on its
own.  You must control the movement to eat algae balls or avoid the
pebbles with the joystick.  Be careful not to run into the fence
around the border, or the game is over.  Before using the joystick,
wait to see which way the earthworm is moving.  If you backtrack over
a path you've already made, the game is over.

Scoring 

Scoring is simple.  You are awarded 10 points for each algae ball
eaten.  Because hitting pebbles, running into the fence, or
backtracking over your trail ends the game, no points are deducted for
those moves.
