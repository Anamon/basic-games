Space Fleet

You are a star fleet captain, and you're in a tight spot.  Your ships
must get to Espilon Eridani, but between the fleet and the star is a
series of black holes.  Any ship that enters a black hole is lost
forever.  Your assigrunent is to get as many ships as possible through
the field of black holes and reach Espilon Eridani on schedule.

How to Play

Each ship, launched by the computer, travels from left to right.
Manipulate your ship around the black holes towards the right edge of
the screen, using the joystick or the keyboard.  When using the
keyboard, pressing W or f5 causes your ship to climb; pressing X or f7
causes it to dive.

You can control the game by choosing three options:

    A. The number of starships in your fleet;
    B. The speed your starships will travel;
    C. The number of black holes that will block your path.

The computer first asks how many starships you want.  Type any number
from 10 to 50 and then press the RETURN key.  Next, you'll be asked
how fast you want your ships to travel.  Type any number from 1 (the
fastest speed) to 9 (the slowest speed), and hit RETURN.  Third,
indicate how many black holes you want.  Type any number from 50 to
200 and then press RETURN.

If you wish to speed past the introductory screens, just hold down the
Commodore key when the program first starts running.

Scoring 

Your score is based on the number of starships in your fleet, as well
as the number that successfully navigate the field of black holes.
You will also receive points for unsuccessful trips based on how far
you did travel.  You will be awarded a rank from private to 4-star
general, depending on your navigational prowess.  To increase your
chances of a high ranking, you may want to choose a larger number of
starships, a fast starship speed, and a large number of black holes.
