Story of the Orchard

You are a piglet in the orchard. Piglets like food, and orchards are
full of apples, so you've escaped from your pen and run toward the
trees.  Farmer Brown is following close behind, so you have two
minutes to eat all the apples you can before Farmer Brown catches you.

Some of the apples may be out of reach.  Don't worry about them. Just
eat all the apples you can before you have to leave the orchard.

How to Play 

"A-Maze-Ing" is a game of coordination and speed.  Using the joystick,
you move through the maze to find the apples.  You have two minutes to
eat all the apples you can.  If you've eaten all the apples that
aren't hidden hy dead ends of the maze, you can end the game by
pressing f1.

There are 25 apples.  Each time you eat an apple, you'll hear a Gulp!
sound, and the background color of the orchard will change.  When
you've eaten all the apples, a song will play.

Scoring 

At the end of the game, your score will tell you how many apples you
ate, as well as the percentage of the 25 apples that you ate.  You
will also see how long it took you to eat all the apples within reach.

If you're a good piglet, you'll soon be able to eat all the apples in
the orchard, unless one or two are hidden by the orchard maze.  When
you get that good, try to see how much faster you can do it.  If
you're fast enough to eat all the apples in two minutes, see if you
can move like a greased pig and eat all of them in one minute.
