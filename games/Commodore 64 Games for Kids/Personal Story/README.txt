The Personal Story

We all like to hear about ourselves, and children are no exception.
In fact, children are especially impressed to see their names and
their life stories in print.  Children's book companies have made
thousands of dollars on the premise that children will learn to read
faster if they read stories about themselves.

"Personal Story" is programmed with this in mind, but it really isn't
a game for the child to play.  Other than pressing a key on the
computer keyboard to continue the story, the child has no input except
reading along with the words, delighting in the story, and perhaps
increasing his or her reading skills.

How to Play

Before your child sits down with this game, you need to enter the data
for nine variables.  Only then will the game tell a personalized
story.

As you type in the program, you can enter your child's personal data
in lines 10000-10100, or if you entered the program as it's listed
here, you can change it by LISTing these lines, then insert your own
information.  (Be sure the word DATA follows the line number and that
the information has quotation marks.)

The lines and information needed are:

    10000  Enter the child's first name.
    10010  Enter the child's last name.
    10020  Enter BOY or GIRL.
    10030  Enter HE or SHE.
    10040  Enter the child's age.
    10050  Enter the child's birthday -- a month and date, for
             example, MAY 3RD.
    10060  Enter the child's street address.
    10070  Enter the child's city of residence.
    10080  Enter the first name of a good friend of the child.
    10090  Enter the child's phone number.
    10100  Enter the name of the chad's favorite toy.

You may want to enlist the child's help, or you may want to program
the game as a surprise.
