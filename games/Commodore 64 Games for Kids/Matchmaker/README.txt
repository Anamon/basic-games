The Matchmaker 

You're the kingdom's foremost matchmaker, and you've been hired by the
king to keep him distracted from the problems he faces from day to
day.  The king's favorite pastime is throwing things on the floor.
Then he calls you, the matchmaker, to pick everything up.

Being an eccentric king, he doesn't want to make things easy for you.
He has a rule: Whatever he throws on the floor must be picked up with
an object that matches.  Today he's scattered a bunch of flat objects
on the floor and covered them with paper to hide their shapes.  You
have to remove all the objects, pair by pair.  If you want, you can
get others to help you.

How to Play 

"Matchmaker" is a game for one to eight players, with four skill
levels.  Each player must uncover two squares and try to match the
shapes underneath them.  When playing in skill levels 2, 3, or 4, you
must also match the *color* of the objects.

To begin the game, press number 1, 2, 3, or 4 to indicate the skill
level.  The higher the number, the more objects will have to be
matched.  Next, press a number from 1 to 8 to indicate how many people
are playing.  The computer will take a few seconds to build the
Matchmaker screen.

Notice that the top of the screen will indicate two things.  First, it
will tell whose turn it is.  Second, it will indicate whether this is
your first or second choice during a turn.  When the game begins, the
top of the screen will tell you player #1 is about to ask his first
question.

To uncover a square, use the joystick to move the arrow directly
imdemeath it.  When you are in the right position, press the fire
button. (Important: Hold down the fire button as long as you need to
remember what's underneath the square, but don't press it a second
time in the same location or it'll count as your next guess.  This is
particularly crucial when you're playing with more than one person.
If you press the fire button a second time on your second turn, it'll
count as the next player's first guess.)

When you make a match, a whooping noise will sound and the matched
squares will disappear.

Scoring 

Matchmaker is not a game of high points.  The total number of points
is the number of pairs of objects in the game.  If only one person is
playing and there are 20 pairs of objects on the board, the score at
the end will always be 20 unless the game is stopped in the middle.
If more than one person is playing Matchmaker, the final score will
tell how many matches were made by each player.
