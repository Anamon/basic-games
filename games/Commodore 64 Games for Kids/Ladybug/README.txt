Life in the Compost Heap

You're a ladybug, and always hungry.  The best food in town is in
Mrs. Woodstock's compost heap.  It's just full of wonderful, juicy,
rotting tomato leaves.  It's your joy in life to rim around the wire
fence that holds all that tasty food.  Whenever you see a particularly
ripe tomato leaf, you jump for it.

But Mrs. Woodstock broke a mirror last week; not thinking, she threw
the pieces in the compost heap.  Now she's forgotten about the mirror,
but those mirror pieces mean seven years of bad luck for you.  Now,
quite often when you see what looks like a nutritious tomato leaf,
you'll jump for it and end up bouncing all over that compost heap.
What you thought was a leaf turns out to be just a reflection in a
piece of the mirror.  Even if you could eat it, it wouldn't taste
good.

How to Play

You rim around the compost heap waiting for your lunch.  You signal
lunchtime by pressing the space bar.  Eat as many leaves as you can in
as few lunchtimes as possible.

There are ten skill levels in "Ladybug," ranging from (easy) to 9
(hard).  Press the number of the skill level you want and wait for the
game to begin.  Whenever you see a good cluster of leaves, press the
space bar.  If you hit a mirror fragment, you may bounce out of the
compost heap.  If you're lucky, the mirror fragment will bounce you
into another tomato leaf or two along the way.

Keep eating leaves until there aren't any left.  If a leaf seems
impossible to reach, you can either press SHIFT to increase the number
of mirror fragments or you can end the game by pressing f1.

Scoring

At the end of a game, the computer will tell you four things:

    How many leaves were in the compost heap;
    How many leaves you ate;
    How many lunchtimes it took you to eat the leaves; and
    What is your numerical score.

Numerical scores are issued by the computer on the basis of how
efficiently you attacked the compost heap.  The low score is 0, and if
you're good you can probably get scores of a hundred or more.
