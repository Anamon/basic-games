People of the Past

"Movers and Shakers" is a question-and-answer game designed to
acquaint you with the heroes and villains of world history.  You will
be asked up to three questions about selected men and women of
history.  Points are determined by the number of questions you need to
identify a particular character.

How to Play

This game is divided into eight categories:

    A. World Leaders
    B. Artists and Thinkers
    C. Famous Women
    D. American Heroes
    E. Villains and Outlaws
    F. Scientists
    G. Religious Leaders
    H. Random Selections

There are 63 historical characters, but they may appear in more than
one category.  For example, Adolph Hitler would appear in Category A,
but he would also appear in Category E.  All characters are included
in Category H.

To choose a category, type the letter of the category you wish to
play.  Wait ten seconds for the data to load and the game to begin.

You will be asked three questions about each character.  Since the
computer will count misspellings as incorrect answers, here are the
correctly spelled names of the characters:
