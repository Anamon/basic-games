Exploring the Solar System

"Heavenly Bodies" is a question-and-answer game designed to teach the
planets of the solar system.  Points are given if you correctly
identify a planet from a clue given.

How to Play

The game consists of 100 questions, each of which pertains to one of
the nine known planets or the Planet X of astronomical theory.  You
indicate your answer by entering the first letter of the planet.

If you enter an incorrect answer, the correct answer will flash on the
computer screen before play resumes.

You can quit playing at any time by pressing the f1 key.  Your
percentage score will not be affected if you quit before all 100
questions have been asked.

Scoring 

You will receive ten points for each correct answer, and one point
will be deducted for each incorrect response.  A score, based on the
number of questions asked and the number of questions answered
correctly, will be shown at the end of the game.  You will be given
both a numerical score and your percentage score.
