Build a Quiz

This book contains many programs that will teach your kids a wide
assortment of things as they play games.  However, no two kids are
alike, and even one child's needs change from day to day.  "Build a
Quiz" will help you keep on top of those needs.

Build a Quiz comes with two options.  You can build a quiz on any
subject and write it out to tape or disk, or you can give your child
(or yourself) a test on any subject for which you've previously
written a quiz.

If your child isn't doing well in civics, say, and there's a big test
coming up, you can make up a sample test from the child's textbook or
class notes.  Because this is your test, you can make it as general or
specific as you wish.  You can use Build a Quiz to create a test about
the United States Constitution or about the history of your local
government.  Whatever your child needs can be covered with Build a
Quiz, and you can create tests using multiple-choice, true-false, or
completion questions, or a combination of the three.

Build a Quiz has another function, too -- fun.  Maybe your teen-age
son has told you hell pass your quiz on geometry if you pass a quiz he
makes up about rock stars.  Both tests can be constructed with this
program.

Who knows?  Now that you have Build a Quiz, maybe the whole family
will learn something about a variety of unusual subjects.
