The Magic Show 

You're a famous magician, and you've learned how to take an empty
canvas and turn it into a picture without doing any work at
all. Artists would like to know your secret, so they could paint
pictures without messing up their living rooms with sticky paint.
They ask you to tell them how to uncover hidden pictures, but the
secret is not for sale. Your magic is done for free, and just for
friends.

How to Play 

This game of coordination requires only a joystick and a little
patience.  The computer will print a picture on the screen,
camouflaged in the same color as the background of the screen.  Try to
uncover the picture by moving the cursor back and forth with a
joystick to erase the background.  A song will play to indicate the
game is over once every square in the picture field is uncovered.

There are five pictures entered into the basic program.  If you
uncover part of a picture and realize you've seen it before, you can
press the fire button on the joystick to get a new picture.
