Money Talks

You had the day all planned.  You were going to spend the morning
plying with the computer, and you wanted to goof around with your
friends in the afternoon.  After dark, you hoped to borrow enough
money from mom to go to the movies.

Mom has different ideas.  She wants you to go to the grocery store.
The list isn't a long one -- it's just ten items.  But going to the
store isn't exactly the way you wanted to spend your day.

But mom offers a compromise.  She'll give you the money and the
grocery list.  You go to the grocery store and buy everything she
needs.  Any money you save by shopping wisely, you get to keep for
your night at the movies.

The idea still doesn't sound as good as spending the day with your
computer and hanging around with the kids, but it beats missing the
movie altogether.

How to Play

The computer will show you a selection of ten items.  Each time you
need to make a purchase, you may choose between Brand A and Brand B.
Select the brand you think is the better bargain by pressing A or B.
Each time you choose the better buy the computer will let you know
with sound and flashing colors.  If you make a mistake, the computer
screen will go black and you'll get a raspberry.

Scoring

At the end of each game, the computer will tell you the number of wise
purchases you made, followed by the number of unwise choices.  Then
the computer will tell you how much you saved by comparison shopping.
