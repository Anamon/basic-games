The Notecrafter's Craft 

You are a notecrafter.  If the orchestra gives a bad concert, the
newspaper critic will blame the conductor, and the conductor will
blame you.  It's your job to make the orchestra sound good by getting
the instruments to sound just right.

So that you can tune the instruments, the computer will tell just how
a note should sound.  Then it's your responsibility to get the note
made by the musical instrument to sound just like the computer's note.
It takes talent -- a good memory and a good musical ear -- to get a
note exactly right.

How to Play 

The computer will sound a note.  Then it will play the note made by
your musical instrument.  You must raise or lower the note until it
sounds exactly the same as the note you remember from the computer.

Raise or lower a note by p1ressing numbers on the computer keyboard.

To make a note sound lower, press 1, 2, or 3:

    1 = lower the note just a little bit.
    2 = lower the note an average amount.
    3 = lower the note a lot.

To make a note sound higher, press 7, 8, or 9:

    7 = raise the note a little bit.
    8 = raise the note an average amount.
    9 = raise the note a lot.

The sound of your note can be changed as many times as necessary.
When you think the note sounds the same as the computer's note, press
5 to indicate the note matches.

Scoring

When you press 5, the computer will play its note and then play the
note you picked. If the notes are exactly the same, you will be
rewarded with music and flashing lights.

Don't be surprised if your note doesn't exactly match the computer's
note.  Very few people have what is known as perfect pitch.  If your
note doesn't match the computer's note, the computer will tell you how
close you came to matching it.  If you get a perfect match, you're 100
percent correct.

The computer will look at the score and tell you whether your ear for
music is not bad, normal, above average, good, very good, or
excellent.  If your guess is very far off, the computer may not tell
you anything.  If this happens, try again.

If you don't get the note exactly right, or even close to it, don't
give up.  Music is like everything else. You certainly need talent,
but practice is just as important.
