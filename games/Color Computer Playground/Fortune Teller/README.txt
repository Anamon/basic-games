THE FORTUNE TELLER

For Parents and Teachers...

This is an imagination game.  The computer plays the part of a fortune
teller and pretends it can see into the child's future.  This program
will motivate children to develop their writing and typing skills.

For Kids...

Imagine that it's late at night and you are asleep.

A crash of thunder wakes you.  You hear eerie music coming up the
stairs.  You sneak downstairs to see what is making the music.

It's the computer.  Strange messages appear on the com- puter's TV
screen:

    I AM RAM. I AM A WIZARD.
    I AM 10,000 YEARS OLD.
    I LIVE INSIDE YOUR COMPUTER.

This isn't real.  You pinch yourself to see if you are dreaming.
Ouch! Nope.

New messages appear:

    WHEN YOU TURN ON YOUR COMPUTER, I WAKE UP.
    THEN I CAN SEE THE FUTURE.
    I CAN SEE YOUR FUTURE!

All of a sudden, you start to shiver.

The messages continue: 

    ASK ME ANY QUESTION
    WITH A YES OR NO ANSWER
    UP TO 79 CHARACTERS LONG.

    WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION?

Wow! You could use this computer wizard to predict the outcome of
elections, or bet on horse races and make a million dollars.  Or you
could become a superstar reporter and find out the news even before it
happens!

What should be your first question?  You have it!  You type madly.

The wizard flashes a new message:

    I AM GAZING AT MY CRYSTAL BALL...
               GAZING...
               GAZING...
               GAZING...

    I SEE YOUR FUTURE!
    YOUR QUESTION:

    WILL I EVER SCORE A MILLION POINTS
    IN THE NEW ARCADE GAME
    MEATBALL WARS?

    THE ANSWER IS...

The wizard pauses for dramatic suspense.

You press your nose against the glass of the TV screen.  You are so
close the words fuzz up.  Your eyes start to cross.  "What's the
answer?" you cry.

The wizard finally answers:

    YES!!

"Hurray!" you cheer.

You run off to tell the other members of your family about the fortune
teller who lives inside your computer.
