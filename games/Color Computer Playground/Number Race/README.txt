For Parents and Teachers...

also helps them learn the location of the numerals on the computer
keyboard.

For Kids...

How fast can you find a number?  Can you beat the computer?

In this game, the computer flashes a number on the picture screen.
The number is between and 9.  As soon as the number appears, the
computer begins counting. If you can punch the number button on the
keyboard before the computer is done, you win.  If not, the computer
wins.

You win the first round if you can beat the computer for all ten
numbers (0 to 9).  But the computer's not beaten yet.  It will play
you four more rounds, each faster than the last.  If you beat the
computer all five rounds, it quits and you are the winner!
