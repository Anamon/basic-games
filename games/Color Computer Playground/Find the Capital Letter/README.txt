FIND THE CAPITAL LETTER!

For Parents and Teachers...

This game helps children learn the capital letters in the alphabet.
It also teaches them the location of the letter keys on the computer
keyboard.

For Kids...

It's a race! 

The race is between you and the computer.  The computer flashes a
letter on the TV screen.  You have only a few seconds to find that
letter on the keyboard and punch it in.

If you find the letter in time, the computer smiles, whistles, and
says, "RIGHT!"

If you don't, the computer moans, looks sad, and tells you to try
again. Then you get another chance.

If you are fast and you beat the computer, you can ask the computer to
print the letters faster.
