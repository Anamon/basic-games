SCRAMBLED EGGS

For Parents and Teachers...

In the last chapter your children counted goose eggs along with the
computer.  But did you notice that the computer always counted the
eggs *in order*?

In this chapter the computer scrambles the goose eggs.  It has the
option of drawing anywhere from zero goose eggs to 24 goose eggs on
the TV screen.  The children have to count the eggs and type in the
correct answer.  Then the computer erases the old eggs and draws a
bunch of new ones.
