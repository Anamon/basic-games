SCRAMBLED NOTES

For Parents and Teachers...

This game will help children learn musical notes of the C-major scale
in the octave from middle C to high C.  Since the notes are randomly
selected by the computer, the game helps children learn to identify
the different notes just by hearing them.

For Kids...

Take a look at the For Kids section in the last chapter.

A hint: This game is tougher than the last game.  In this game the
notes don't get higher one by one.  In this game, the notes are all
scrambled.  You never know which note will be played next!
