BACKWORDS

For Parents and Teachers...

This game is mostly for fun.  But it teaches children to look at words
in a playful, original way.  It shows them that words aren't fixed and
frozen.  They can be flipped over and turned around.  The result is
amusing and often surprising.

For Kids...

Did you ever wonder what your name looks like spelled backwards?  I
did.  So I tried this computer game.

When the computer typed "FRONTWORDS?"  I typed my name -- FRED.

A message flashed on the TV screen:

    BACKWORDS MACHINE NOW WORKING

Moments later, the computer printed my name forwards and backwards.
Forwards it was FRED.  Backwards it was DERF!

What does your name look like backwards?  Or your mom's name?  Or your
dad's?  Or your favorite hero's name?

Use this game to find out.
