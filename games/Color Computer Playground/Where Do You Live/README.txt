WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

For Parents and Teachers...

This game helps children learn their address, including their street,
apartment, city, state, and zip code.  It teaches them how to format
their address on an envelope.

For Kids...

This game helps you learn your address and how to write your address
on an envelope when you send a letter.

The computer asks you for your first name.  Next it asks for your last
name.  Then it prints out your name and address, just the way you
would write them on an envelope to mail to your grandparents or to a
friend.

Then the computer asks you to type in your address, one part at a
time.  It asks you for your street, your apartment (if you live in an
apartment), your city, your state, and your zip code.

If you can't remember part of your address, don't worry.  Try
guessing.  The computer will give you three chances, then it will let
you peek at the part of the address you can't remember.  Then it will
hide it and ask you to type it in yourself.

Maybe some parts will take dozens of tries to get just right.  But the
computer won't lose its temper or grumble.  It never gets upset.  It
just keeps playing the game until you know your whole address.

Background...

The Where Do You Live address game was developed by Melissa Perdue, a
student at Patrick Henry High School in Roanoke, Virginia.
