UP, UP AND AWAY!

For Parents and Teachers...

Like the game in the last chapter, this game helps children learn
directions -- up, down, left, and right -- and direction names.

This game is an expanded version of the up-down game from the last
chapter.  It shows what happens when you add animation and sound
effects to the game.

For Kids...

This game is a lot like the game in the last chapter.  Only this time
the arrows move and play funny music.

To play this game, just search for the arrows on the computer
keyboard.  Press the arrow that matches the arrow on the TV screen.
Remember to shout out the directions: "UP!"  "DOWN!" "LEFT!" and
"RIGHT!"
