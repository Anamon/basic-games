SCRAMBLED BEES

For Parents and Teachers...

This game helps children practice spelling.  You or your children
enter ten words into the computer.  The computer arranges the words in
a random order and then quizzes the children on each word.  The
children can take the computer quiz over and over until they have
mastered all the words.

For Kids...

In this chapter we create a "scrambled" spelling bee.  The computer
juggles the words around.  Then it gives you the spelling bee with the
words in the new order.  And if you ask the computer to quiz you again
on the same words, it will scramble the words again.  Then it will
give you the spelling bee.
