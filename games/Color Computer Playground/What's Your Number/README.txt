WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER?

For Parents and Teachers...

This game will help younger children learn their telephone number.

For Kids...

The computer is going to help you learn your phone number.

When you type RUN, the phone game begins.  The computer asks you for
your name and your phone number.  Your mom or dad can write it down on
a piece of paper.  Then you can type the number on the computer's
typewriter.  Then hide the paper -- and don't peek.

The computer will ask you for the number again.  Can you remember it?

If you can't remember, try guessing.  After three wrong guesses, the
computer will let you peek at the number.  Then it will hide it and
ask if you want to play the game again.  Type "YES" and see if you can
get the number right.

If it takes you a long time, don't worry.  The computer never loses
its patience and never gets angry.  It won't growl at you or stick out
its tongue.  It keeps playing the game until you know your phone
number perfectly.

Background...
