THE SKYWRITER

For Parents and Teachers...

This is an imagination game.  The computer asks children for any
sequence of letters or numbers.  Then it displays the letters or
numbers, over and over, all across the TV screen.  This is a good game
for teaching children how to spell their own names or the names of
their pets and other members of their family.

For Kids...

Have you ever seen a skywriter?  A skywriter is an airplane that flies
high up in the sky and leaves a white smokey trail.  Sometimes the
skywriter draws letters, words, and even pictures.

Wouldn't it be nice if you had your own skywriter and could draw your
name in big, puffy cloud letters that everyone could see?

Buying a real skywriter would be expensive.  But why not use your
computer?  The computer can draw your name on the screen really fast,
just like a skywriter streaking across the sky.

But why stick just to your name?  Let's have the computer "skywriter"
draw any message you can think up.
