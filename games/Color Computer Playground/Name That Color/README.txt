NAME THAT COLOR!

For Teachers and Parents...

This game helps children learn colors and the color names.  The
computer flashes a color on the picture screen.  It also displays a
color name on the middle of the screen.  If the color name does not
match the color, the child presses the SPACE bar and a new color name
appears.  The child asks the computer for new color names until he
finds the color name that matches the color.  Then he presses the
ENTER button.

For Kids...

Pretend that you are in a carnival funhouse.  Each of the rooms in the
funhouse is a different color.  You are stuck in a room until you
guess its color.  Then you can go on to the next room.  Can you escape
from the funhouse?
