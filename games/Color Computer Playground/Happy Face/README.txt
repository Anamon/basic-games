HAPPY FACE

For Parents and Teachers...

This is a game subroutine or "helper program."  You can attach the
subroutine onto most of the game programs in this book.  When children
get a correct answer, the subroutine prints a happy face, plays a
happy tune, and congratulates the child.

For Kids...

When you do something right, you expect a smile and a word of praise,
right?

Here's a little program that draws a happy face on the TV screen,
prints out the message "RIGHT!" and plays a happy "whistle."
