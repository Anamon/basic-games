HOW FAST ARE YOU?

For Parents and Teachers...

This game helps children develop hand-eye coordination and
concentration.

The computer draws a line from left to right across the screen.  As
soon as the child sees the line appear on the lefthand side of the
screen, he or she presses the SPACE bar.  When the SPACE bar or any
other key is pressed, the line stops.  The faster the child reacts,
the better the score.

For Kids...

How fast are you?

To find out, step right up and have a duel with the computer.

The computer will print a yellow block on the TV screen.  It will tell
you "GET READY!"  Then a little red line will shoot across the screen,
from left to right.  As soon as you see the line appear on the left
side of the screen, press the SPACE bar.  The line will stop, and the
computer will tell you how fast you are.

The slower you are, the longer the line on the screen.  The faster you
are, the shorter the line.

The computer will also tell you how much time passed between the time
when the line first appeared and when you pressed the SPACE bar and
stopped the line.

Keep playing the game to see if you can improve your time.

If the game gets too simple, change the rules.  If you are
right-handed, start pressing the SPACE bar with your left hand.  If
you are left-handed, start using your right hand.  Or use your nose.
Or your elbow.  Or turn around and use a mirror.

Let your whole family try the game.  Have a family championship.
Maybe you can even teach your dog or cat how to play!
