SPELLING BEE

For Parents and Teachers...

This game helps children practice spelling.  You or your children
enter the words into the computer, and then the computer quizzes the
children on each word.  The children can take the computer quiz over
and over until they have mastered all the words.

For Kids...

The computer first asks you for 10 words you would like to know how to
spell.  Maybe they are the 10 words that will be appearing on your
spelling test tomorrow morning.

You type in the 10 words, one at a time.

The computer lines you up against the wall and starts quizzing you.
It shows you word number one -- "PIZZA."  Then the word disappears.
The computer asks, "WORD?"

"PEETSAH," you type.

The computer frowns, moans, and says, "SORRY ... TRY AGAIN."

You try again: "PIZZA."

"RIGHT!" says the computer.  It smiles and whistles.  Then it flashes
word number two.
