NEWS BULLETIN!

For Parents and Teachers...

This is an imagination game. Children pretend the computer is a giant
marquee in a big city.  They get to think up any message they want to
put on that marquee.

This game will encourage children to compose unusual sentences and
messages.  It will help them develop their writing and typing skills.

For Kids...

How would you like to see your name on TV?  Or in the movies?  How
would it feel to go to a theater and see your name up there in lights
along with famous movie stars?  Wouldn't it be great to be mentioned
on a "World News" program some night?

Or, have you ever thought about making up your own newspaper
headlines?  They could be serious, or they could be crazy, weird, or
funny.

You can make up your own headlines.  And you can be in them, too!
How?  On your computer -- using the News Bulletin game.

When you load and run the News Bulletin game, it asks you to enter
your news bulletin.  Type in whatever you think up.  The game turns
your message into headline letters that march across the TV screen.
Each letter makes its own special musical note.

Now turn out the lights in your room.  Sit down on the floor beneath
the glowing computer TV screen.  Pretend it is nighttime and you are
in a huge city.  Look up.  Your bulletin appears, and millions of
people can see it!
