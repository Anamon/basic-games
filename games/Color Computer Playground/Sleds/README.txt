SLEDS

For Parents and Teachers...

This game is similar to The Roller Coaster game.  It helps children
learn about trigonometric functions.  The computer draws one function
-- the cosecant function -- on the TV screen.  Children can experiment
with the game and make all sorts of different shapes.

For Kids...

In the last chapter we created a roller coaster.  In this chapter we
look at just how you go about using a derived function to create new
pictures.  By making only a couple of modifications to the roller
coaster program, we end up with sleds!
