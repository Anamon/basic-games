SAD FACE

For Parents and Teachers...

This game subroutine is to be used along with the Happy Face
subroutine.  It can be attached to most of the games in this book.
When children answer the computer's question incorrectly, the
subroutine draws a sad face on the TV screen, makes a sad sound, and
prints the message "SORRY . . . TRY AGAIN."

For Kids...

When you miss a question or get the wrong answer, what do you expect?
Probably a sad face.  Maybe a sad sound.  And, hopefully,
encouragement to try again.

Here is a little program that does all that.  It prints a sad face on
the TV screen.  Under the face it prints the message "SORRY . . . TRY
AGAIN."  And it makes a sad sound.
