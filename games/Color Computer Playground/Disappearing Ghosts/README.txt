THE DISAPPEARING GHOSTS

For Parents and Teachers...

This game helps children practice subtraction.

A number of ghosts appear above their tombstones.  They disappear.
Then some of the ghosts reappear.  The game asks children how many of
the ghosts disappeared and didn't return.

For Kids...

Imagine that it is late at night.  You and your best friend are late
for dinner.  You take a shortcut across an old cemetery.

You hear a noise.  You both turn around.

You are surrounded by ghosts!  They are everywhere, peeking over the
tops of tombstones.

You start to scream!

The ghosts disappear.

Then some of them return!

This time you don't take the time to scream.  You plan to do some
quick disappearing yourself.  You grab your friend's hand and run like
the wind!

You return home, puffing and panting.  You tore your pants scrambling
over the cemetery fence.  You look over your shoulder.  No ghosts.

You sit down at your computer.  You load in the Ghosts game and type
RUN.

There they are again!  Ghosts' heads pop over the top of 12
tombstones.  You count them.

The ghosts disappear.

Then seven of the ghosts return.

The computer asks you: "HOW MANY GHOSTS THE FIRST TIME?"

You answer: "12."

The computer asks you: "HOW MANY GHOSTS THE SECOND TIME?"

You answer: "7."

Then the computer asks you: "HOW MANY OF THE GHOSTS DISAPPEARED?"

This time you kept a careful count.  You type the number 5.

A happy blue and white ghost appears on the TV screen.  "RIGHT!" it
says.
