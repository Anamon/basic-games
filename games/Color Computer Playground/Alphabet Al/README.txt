ALPHABET AL

For Parents and Teachers...

This game helps children learn the letters of the alphabet.  The
letters appear on the screen, and the children have to find them on
the computer keyboard.

For Kids... 

Remember Johnny Appleseed?  Johnny went all over America planting
seeds.  The seeds sprouted and grew into apple trees with bright red,
juicy apples.

But what would have happened if Johnny had planted "letter" seeds
instead of apple seeds?  Then letters would have sprouted all over
America in place of apples.

In the program below we have created a new American folk hero,
"Alphabet Al."  Al is crazy about letters (the way Johnny was crazy
about apples).  He journeys across America with a bag of letter seeds
strung over his shoulder.  Each time he reaches a new state, he races
across it, planting seeds to make a new letter of the alphabet.

Type in and run the Alphabet Al program.  You won't see Al himself,
but you can follow his path by watching "alphabet" seeds sprout into
letters.  Listen to the noises the letters make when they blossom.

When Al is finished planting each letter, his trail of letters
disappears.  But before Al goes to a new state, he stops and asks you
what letter he has just planted.  He keeps asking the question until
you get it right.  Then, off he goes again, planting new letters.
