MUSICAL WORDS

For Parents and Teachers...

This game helps children learn important words and numbers, such as
their name, phone number, address, etc.  The child types in a word (or
number) and the computer sets it to music and plays it like a song.
The computer accepts only the correct letters or numbers.  All other
keys on the computer keyboard are "asleep."

For Kids...

Pretend that you have a magic horn.  When you blow it, out pops a
pretty sound.  But something else comes out, too: a letter.

You try playing the horn again.  A new sound comes out.  And out flies
a different letter.

You play lots of different sounds on your horn.  Letters come zooming
out of the horn.  They bump together and form a word.  The word looks
familiar.  It's your name.  And it's musical!

You can make your name musical.  But that's not all.  Try setting your
mom's name to music.  Or your dad's name.  Or your little sister's
name.  Or the name of your favorite pet gerbil.  Next, try out your
phone number, your street name, your city, and your state.  Like your
name, they can all be musical.
