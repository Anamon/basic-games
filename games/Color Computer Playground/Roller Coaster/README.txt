THE ROLLER COASTER

For Parents and Teachers...

This game helps children learn about the sine function in
trigonometry.  It draws colorful sine curves on the TV screen.  With
modifications, the program can draw curves of the other trigonometric
functions.

For Kids...

How would you like to become a video artist?  You can make
interesting, beautiful pictures by using a few simple recipes.  The
recipes you use are mathematical formulas.

If you didn't use the formulas, you would have to tell the computer to
draw each square or point in the picture.  The formulas take care of
calculating all of the points automatically.

Also, video art is a good way to spice up your math homework. By
themselves, mathematical formulas can be complicated and boring.  But
they all describe some sort of shape.  That shape might be beautiful.
You can get your computer to draw the shapes on the TV screen.  It
makes math more interesting, and it is a lot easier than drawing the
shapes yourself on a piece of graph paper.

This game is an example of video art using a sine function.  The
program draws a picture of a multi-colored roller coaster.
