SECRET AGENT

For Parents and Teachers...

This is an imagination game.  It takes words and sentences and turns
them into secret codes for children to pass around and try to figure
out.  This game might act as an incentive to encourage your children
to practice writing and typing on the computer.

For Kids...

Pretend you are agent Triple-Nine.  You have a secret message that you
have to deliver to the president of a small country nestled in the
Andes Mountains in South America.  The message contains the plans to a
powerful, new, top-secret Quark bomb.  The president needs this bomb
to defend his country against an imminent attack of robot guerillas
from a neighboring country.

You are almost ready to board your private jet and fly to the
president's country.  But first, in case you meet with foul play, you
need to translate the bomb plans into a secret code.  Then, even if
the plans fall into the enemy's hands, they will be useless.

You can invent a secret code.  Then you can take each letter of each
word in the bomb plans and translate it.

But this would take forever.  Anyway, you already have a coding
machine.  It's your computer.

You turn on the computer, load the Secret-Agent program, and type RUN.
The computer asks you for your code name.  You type 999. " GOOD NAME!"
says the computer.  "I LIKE IT!"

You type in the secret plans, one line at a time.  A message flashes
on the TV screen: "CODING MACHINE NOW WORKING."  Moments later the
coded bomb plans appear on the screen.  You copy them down and destroy
the original plans.  You board your airplane and head for South
America.
