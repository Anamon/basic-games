UNO! DOS! TRES!

For Parents and Teachers...

This game helps children learn how to count from zero to 10 in
Spanish.

For Kids...

When you RUN this program, the screen turns blank.  At the bottom, the
computer asks "NUMBER (0-10)?"  You can type any number from to 10.
Let's say you type a 5.  The computer puts a 5 on the screen and
underneath it the word for 5 in Spanish:

      5 
    CINCO 

When the computer prints the number, it plays a special musical tone.
The computer asks you to say the name of the number, first in English
and then in Spanish.

If you keep practicing the numbers in Spanish you will soon be able to
say them all without any help from the computer:

"CERO! UNO! DOS! TRES! CUATRO! CINCO! SEIS! SIETE! OCHO! NUEVE! DIEZ!"
