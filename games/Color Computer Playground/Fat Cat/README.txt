FAT CAT

For Parents and Teachers...

This game helps children learn phonetic symbols and phonetic sounds.
The computer displays the phonetic symbols on the TV screen.  Then it
flashes a word on the screen.  The child says the word aloud and tries
to guess which phonetic sound is hidden inside the word.  An arrow
points to the first phonetic symbol.  To move the arrow to a new
symbol, the child presses the SPACE bar.  To select a symbol the child
presses the ENTER button.

For Kids...

Did you ever notice how certain words rhyme or sound alike?  Words
like "red" and "bed", or "big" and "pig", or "fat" and "cat"?

The reason the words rhyme is that they have the same phonetic sound
(or phoneme) hidden inside them.  For example, hiding inside the words
red and bed is the phoneme /e/.  Hidden inside the words big and pig
is the phoneme /i/.  And inside the words fat and cat is the phoneme
/a/.

In this game you get to play detective.  The computer will flash a
word on your TV screen.  Say the word out loud a couple of times.  Now
look at the list of phonemes on the screen.  Your job as a sound
detective is to discover which phoneme is hidden inside the word.
