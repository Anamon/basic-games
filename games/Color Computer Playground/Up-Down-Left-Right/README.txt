UP-DOWN-LEFT-RIGHT

For Parents and Teachers...

This game helps children learn directions: up, down, left, and right.
It also helps them recognize the direction words.

For Kids...

Look for the arrow keys on the keyboard.  Do you see them?  Now,
you're ready.

The computer asks you: "WHICH DIRECTION?"

On the screen you see an arrow and a word.  What arrow do you see?
It's the up arrow.  The arrow is pointing to the word "UP."  Say the
word out loud.  Shout it out!

Can you find the same arrow on the computer keyboard?  Press
it.  Hurray!

Now a different arrow and a different word appear.  This is the down
arrow and the word "DOWN."  Shout out the word "DOWN!"  Find the down
arrow on the keyboard and press it.

Next, a different arrow and a different word appear.  This is the left
arrow and the word "LEFT."  Shout out the word "LEFT!"  Find the left
arrow on the keyboard and press it.

One last arrow and one last word appear.  This is the right arrow and
the word "RIGHT."  Shout out the word "RIGHT!"  Find the right arrow
on the keyboard and press it.

The game is over.  The computer will ask you if you want to play
again.  You should type in "YES" or "Y."  This time you are on your
own.  Good luck!
