AL'S TOUR OF THE STATES

For Parents and Teachers...

This game teaches children the names of all the states.  A letter
appears on the screen, and the children have to guess which state
begins with that letter.  If they can't think of any states or they
can't spell the state name, the computer will let them peek at the
state names beginning with each letter.

For Kids...

Here's Alphabet Al sowing "alphabet" seeds all over the country.  When
Al visits a state he finds out the first letter in the state's name
and then plants only that letter.  For example, Al plants T's all over
Texas, A's all over Alaska, and N's all over New Jersey.

Al doesn't plant any B's, E's, J's, Q's, X's, Y's, or Z's, since there
are no states beginning with those letters.

After Al enters a new state and plants a letter, he stops and asks you
to guess what state he is in.  If you guess a state that begins with
the letter Al has just planted, you win.  If not, Al lets you try
again.

If you can't think of a state beginning with the right letter, just
press the ENTER button.  Al will flash all the states beginning with
that letter on the TV screen.  When you're through studying the state
names, just press ENTER again (or any other key).  Then Al gives you
another chance.
