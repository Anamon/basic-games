DO-RE-MI

For Parents and Teachers...

This game helps children learn the names of the notes of the C-major
scale in the octave from middle C to high C.  It also helps them learn
the pitch of each note.

For Kids...

Pretend yon are sitting outside, on the grass, on a warm summer
evening.  You look up at the stars and the moon, and you hear music.
Actually, what you hear is a single note floating somewhere,
invisible, high in the air.

You have your flashlight with you. You turn on the light and take out
your "Kid's Guide to Nighttime Music".  You try to identify the
musical note playing in the dark sky.

Is it C?  D?  E?  F?  G?  A?  B?  Or High C?

You guess that it is middle C.  You look up at the moon and hum the
note.  "Middle C," you say.  "Is it Middle C?"

The moon begins to smile.  "Right!" it calls.  The moon and stars play
a happy tune.

Now a new mystery note glides through the air.  You switch your
flashlight back on and turn your book's pages.  Is the new note a
middle C?  Is it a D?  An E?
