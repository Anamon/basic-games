UN! DEUX! TROIS!

For Parents and Teachers...

This game helps children learn how to count from zero to 10 in French.

For Kids...

When you RUN this program, the screen turns blank.  At the bottom, the
computer asks "NUMBER (0-10)?"  You can type any number from to 10.
Let's say you type a 5.  The computer puts a 5 on the screen and
underneath it the word for 5 in French:

     5 
    CINQ 

When the computer prints the number, it plays a special musical tone.
The computer asks you to say the name of the number, first in English
and then in French.

If you keep practicing the numbers in French you will soon be able to
say them all without any help from the computer:

"NUL! UN! DEUX! TROIS! QUATRE! CINQ! SIX! SEPT! HUIT! NEUF! DIX!"
