THE ABC SONG

For Parents and Teachers...

This game helps younger children learn the alphabet.  It displays the
letters of the alphabet while it plays the "Alphabet Song."

If your child isn't quick-tongued now, he or she will be after singing
along with this program.

The program plays the ABC Song very slowly the first time.  As it
plays, it flashes the appropriate letter of the alphabet on the TV
screen.

Your child will sing along and be proud that he or she can sing faster
than the computer.

But, wait. The computer plays the ABC Song again.  This time it plays
faster.

Then it plays again -- faster -- and faster -- and faster!

My young son has a ball trying to keep up with the computer.  And he's
becoming an alphabet expert, too!
