MAKE UP A SONG

For Parents and Teachers...

This game will help children learn how to create musical notes and
tunes.  It will teach them how different notes can be combined in
beautiful, harmonious, or unusual ways.

For Kids...

Pretend that your computer is an electronic guitar.  You pick notes on
a guitar.  You combine the notes into songs.  Now you can do that on
your computer, too.

When you RUN the Notes program, it will first play all the notes
between middle C and high C (including the sharps).  Listen carefully
to these notes as the computer plays them.

Then the computer will ask you to "PICK A NOTE."  To choose the notes
in your tune, you need to press only one of two buttons -- the SPACE
bar or the ENTER button.  You press the ENTER button to select a note
to go in your tune.  You press the SPACE bar to change the notes on
the TV screen until the note displayed is the one you want to select.

You can create a song out of notes -- one note played right after the
other.  This game will let you create a song with up to 10 notes.

After you have created a single tune, the computer will ask you if you
want to create a new tune.  Answer "Y" to create a new one.  If you
answer "N," the computer will play the notes in your existing song.

After the computer has played all the notes, it will ask you if you
want to hear the old tune again.  If you type "N," it will ask you if
you want to make a new tune.  If you don't, the game will end.  But if
you do want to make a new tune and answer "Y," the computer will erase
your old song and let you create a new one.
