GOBLIN

  by Dan Goff
  64 Translation by Patrick Parrish

In "Goblin," custom characters are used to create a simple yet
entertaining game.  The object is to capture the scowling creatures
with your goblin while avoiding the many block-shaped obstacles that
lie in your path.

After obstacles and sad faces have been positioned, "Goblin" begins
when the main character appears at the bottom of the screen.  As the
game progresses, the goblin moves continually upward and the player
controls only its horizontal movement.  The O and P keys, in
conjunction with the GET command in line 260, enable the player to
move the goblin left and right, respectively.  Children especially
like the cumulative effect of the GET statement; they make rapid key
punches and then wait for the delayed effects.

As each sad face is captured by the goblin, the score is updated and
printed at the upper left.  If the goblin successfully clears the
screen of all the faces, an entirely new playfield will be provided.
A game lasts as long as you wish.

A single round ends when the goblin crashes into an obstacle.  At this
point, the remaining sad faces smile, and you are asked if you wish to
play again.

If you play again, your previous highest score will be posted as the
new game begins.  The incentive to exceed a record score makes any
game more fun.
