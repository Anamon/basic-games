CYLON ZAP

Quick reflexes are what you'll need for this fast-action game.  "Cylon
Zap" is an arcade-style game.  A space station in the center of the
screen, which you must defend at all costs, is attacked continually by
Cylon ships.  You must shoot them before they dive (kamikaze style)
into the space station.

To defend against the Cylons, you have two weapons.  First, the
joystick is moved up, down, right, or left to fire lasers in any of
these four directions.  Second, the fire button detonates a smart
bomb, which immediately clears the screen of all visible attackers.
Smart bombs should be used sparingly, for only three are available at
the beginning of play.

The score and the number of remaining bombs are continually updated at
the upper-left comer of the screen.  When the score reaches 30, the
flank attackers begin to increase speed.  When your score reaches 50,
the attackers from the top and bottom increase their speed.  If your
score exceeds 60, you win bonus smart bombs.

If your point total is a high score since the program was first
loaded, you enter your initials with the joystick.  Moving the stick
right or left lets you step through the alphabet forward or backward.
When you find the correct letter, select it with the fire button.  Be
sure not to hold the fire button down too long when selecting your
initials, or you may inadvertently choose the wrong letters.
