DIAMOND DROP

Catch the falling diamonds -- if you can.  This fast-action game is
easy to play.

"Diamond Drop" is a game that requires good judgment and quick
reflexes.  It's fast and easy to play.  To insure fast action, it is
written predominantly in machine language.  BASIC is used only to
print instructions, set up the display, select the skill level, and
initiate the drop.

The game display starts with six rows of objects at the top of the
screen and a stack of six catching trays at the bottom.  As the
objects begin to drop, you must use the L and ; keys to maneuver the
trays and catch the objects.  To make play more challenging, one tray
disappears whenever the last ball drops from a row.

Thus, you have only one tray with which to catch objects from the last
row.  When all the objects have dropped, you start again with six rows
of objects and six trays.  Play continues until a total of five
objects hit the ground.

Since the DATA statements comprise the machine language program for
the game, it is essential that they be typed correctly.  Be sure to
SAVE a copy of the program before you attempt to RUN it, since an
error in typing may cause your computer to lock up, forcing you to
turn the power off to recover.  If Diamond Drop fails to RUN properly,
the problem will most likely be a mistyped number somewhere in the
DATA statements, so check carefully.
