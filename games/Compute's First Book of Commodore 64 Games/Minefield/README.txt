MINEFIELD

  by Sean Igo
  64 Translation by Gregg Peele

In this game, you drive a truck around to gather and defuse time bombs
before they explode -- all the while avoiding mines and bomb craters.

Your job is to get your trucks in quickly, defuse the bombs
(especially the flashing ones which are about to go off), and get out
as fast as you can.  This game has four skill levels.

Playing the Game

You find yourself in the center of a small minefield with several
bombs, represented by circles, and a generous number of mines, shown
as X's.  Your truck is a diamond.  To defuse the bombs, just run over
them with the truck.

When the bombs first appear, they are innocent-looking little circles.
After a short time -- the rate varies from bomb to bomb -- they turn
reverse-field.  This means watch it.  Soon they begin to blink, and
you have only a few blinks to defuse them before they explode.  Any
mines (or heroic defusing teams) caught in the explosion will be
instantly lost.  Bombs caught in the explosion will explode, whether
they were ready to or not.

Your truck can move in only four directions.  It can wrap around all
four edges of the screen.  Don't run it into the mines or the craters
(*) left by the bombs or your truck will be destroyed.

Once you begin moving, your truck cannot stop until it is blown up or
until the current minefield is cleared of bombs.

Skill Levels and Scoring 

"Minefield" has four skill levels.  Skill levels differ only in the
number of trucks you get.  Level 0, the easiest, has four trucks.
Level 1 has three.  Level 2 has two, and level 3 has one.

Scoring:

   10 points for a normal bomb
   20 points for a reverse-field bomb
   30 points for a blinking bomb
  -10 points at the end of an explosion for every bomb that went off.
      This is incentive to defuse more than one or two bombs in the
      later explosions.
