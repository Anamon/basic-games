LANDER

This game simulates the landing of an Earth-Moon shuttle.  The
automatic controls have broken down, forcing you, the commander, to
take charge.  Each second, you must specify the amount of fuel to
burn.  If you don't burn any, you accelerate.  If you burn more fuel
than a certain amount (different in every gravity well) you accelerate
in the opposite direction.  The idea behind the game is to gauge how
much fuel to burn to effect as smooth a landing as possible.  This is
measured by your velocity as you land.  A perfect landing is one in
which velocity is less than one foot per second.  At five feet per
second or less, the landing is counted as rough but survivable.  A
landing of greater than five feet per second is considered fatal.  If
you do crash, the screen flashes violently and emits the sound of an
explosion.

The danger to be wary of is of burning too much fuel.  This is very
real, since you have not been given much to start with.  If you run
out of fuel, the game goes on, but you are no longer consulted about
how much fuel to burn since you have none.  A falling sound is
generated and the status of the ship continues to print out until the
inevitable crash, which ends the game.

It is recommended that you try landing on the moon first, since it is
easier to land there because the gravity is weaker than Earth's.
Happy landings!
