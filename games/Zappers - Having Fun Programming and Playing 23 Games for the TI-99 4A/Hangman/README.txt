HANGMAN

Like "Scramble," "Hangman" also has the computer select a word at
random from a given list.  However, here the computer displays a dash
(or rather an underscore character) for each of the letters of the
word selected.  The human player has to guess the letters which
compose the word.  When a correct letter is guessed, the computer
places it in the correct place in the word, eliminating the dash.
However, each time an incorrect letter is typed, another letter from
the word "Hangman" is displayed near the top of the screen.  Once the
word "Hangman" is spelled out in full the game is over and the player
has lost.
