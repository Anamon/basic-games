SCRAMBLER

Scrambler is a game for testing your pattern-perception and vocabulary
skills.  The game consists of a timed quiz in which you are asked to
recognize a series of random words, presented one at a time, which
have been randomly jumbled.  It is not enough to figure out each
original word, however.  You must also type it, correctly spelled,
within the time interval allotted.  At the higher levels, this may not
be so easy -- particularly if you increase the word list stored in the
DATA statements.
