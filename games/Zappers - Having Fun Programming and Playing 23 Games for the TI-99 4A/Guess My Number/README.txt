GUESS MY NUMBER

The game "Guess My Number" permits the user to specify a range of
numbers from which the computer picks a number out of its hat, so to
speak.  The wider the range selected, the greater the number of
guesses that will be necessary before the "hidden" number is arrived
at.  With each guess, the computer responds with one of three answers:
TOO SMALL, TOO LARGE, or CORRECT, YOU WIN!  The number of guesses
allotted is determined mathematically by the computer and is based on
the range that the user selects.  If the correct answer has not been
selected in the allotted number of guesses, the computer prints out
SORRY, YOU LOSE. THE ANSWER WAS..., followed by the random number that
the computer selected.
