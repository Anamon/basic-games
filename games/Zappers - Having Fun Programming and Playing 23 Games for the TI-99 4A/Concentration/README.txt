CONCENTRATION

This program is a computer version of the very popular card game
bearing the same name.  In the game, two players are pitted against
each other. The fifty-two cards of the deck are laid out face down in
four rows of thirteen cards each.  The rows are numbered 1 through 4,
while the columns are labeled A through M.  In this grid system, any
one of the fifty-two cards may be selected by first specifying its row
and then its column.  Each player goes in turn and names two cards by
specifying the column and row of each with a letter and number.  If
the two cards match (suits are ignored in this game), they are removed
from play and one point is awarded the player, who gets to go again.
If the cards do not match, the other player goes.  The game continues
until all the cards are off the board, at which time the player with
the highest score wins.
