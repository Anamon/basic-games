HIDDEN WORD SEARCH

This program generates a hidden-word puzzle.  The words are selected
from a series of DATA statements.  Once selected, they are displayed
on the screen.  The object of the game is for the player to find these
words on the screen.  However, this is not as easy as it may appear,
since the words may be displayed in any one of eight directions --
left to right, right to left, vertically in either direction, or
diagonally in all possible directions.  None of the words on the
screen overlap, so there is no sharing of letters.  Moreover, to make
the task of recognizing the words even more difficult, all the empty
spaces on the grid are filled with random letters of the alphabet.  Up
to thirty-five to sixty words can be placed in one puzzle, depending
on the length of the words.  Using the words shown in the listing, the
maximum is about thirty-nine.
