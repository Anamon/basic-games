ROULETTE

The game presented here is a computer version of roulette, a popular
gambling game.  In the game, a ball is rolled onto a spinning disk
divided into little compartments.  When the spinning finally stops,
the ball rests in one of them.  All the compartments are of various
colors and are marked with numbers.  There are seventy-four in all --
the numbers 1-36 in black and red and and 00 in green.  The player may
bet that the ball will land on any number, on an odd or even number,
or on the colors red, black, or green.  The odds that are obtained by
each are shown below:

    Bet     Odds
    -----   ----
    any #   36:1 
    red      2:1
    black    2:1
    green   18:1
    odd      2:1
    even     2:1

The object of the game is to make as much money as possible.  In our
computer world, there are no limits to how much you can make, but the
casino has seen fit to impose a table limit of $5.00 minimum and
$500.00 maximum, so that you can't win as fast as you might like.
