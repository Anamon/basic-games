SNAZZLE

"Snazzle" is another fast-action graphics game.  This time, you are
playing the role of a snake.  You start off small (five blocks long)
but every time you eat a piece of food, you get longer.  Your object
is to eat all the pieces of food that appear on the screen while not
running into the blue electrified wall -- or yourself.  If you do hit
either of the above-mentioned barriers, you die.  You avoid your
horrible fate by deftly changing the direction of the snake's motion
using the E, S, D, and X keys to represent up, left, right, and down,
respectively.  If you survive long enough to eat ten pieces of food,
you then move on to the second level, where you have more barriers to
run into, making your task even harder.  This may sound like a raw
deal but, after all â€”- it's a snake's life!
