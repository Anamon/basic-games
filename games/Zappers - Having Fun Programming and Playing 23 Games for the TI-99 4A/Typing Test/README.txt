TYPING TEST

The following program has been devised to familiarize you with the
keyboard of the TI-99/4A and to improve both your reflexes and typing
skills at the same time.  This is a timed-response quiz, which means
that if you don't type the correct key within a certain period of time
(a time interval which gets smaller with every level) you are scored
as having missed the key.  The game starts off so slowly that you may
easily be led to believe that the quiz is a breeze.  But as the levels
progress, you'll realize that nothing could be further from the truth,
and even the most skilled typists will have a very hard time keeping
up, especially at level 10 (the most difficult).
