ORGAN

This program gives you the opportunity to express yourself musically
by simulating a two-octave piano or organ keyboard.  The key labeled C
on the TI-99/4A keyboard substitutes for middle C.  Every other note
in its octave is in the same relative position as may be found on a
piano, as shown in the following diagram:

  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   0   =
     [A#]    [C#][D#]    [F#][G#]

    Q   W   E   R   T   Y   U   I   O   P   /
   [A] [B] [C] [D] [E] [F] [G] [A]

      A   S   D   F   G   H   J   K   L   ;   ENT
         [A#]    [C#][D#]    [F#][G#]

    SFT Z   X   C   V   B   N   M   ,   .   SFT
       [A] [B] [C] [D] [E] [F] [G]

The note C in the second octave is obtained by pressing the W key.
Again, every note in this octave is situated in the same position
relative to W as the corresponding keys in the first octave.  The
highest note allowed for by this program, A, is obtained by pressing
the I key.

Notes are played one at a time in this version, but it is possible to
modify this basic tool to include multiple voices, volume control,
more octaves -- it is only limited by your imagination and skill as a
programmer.
