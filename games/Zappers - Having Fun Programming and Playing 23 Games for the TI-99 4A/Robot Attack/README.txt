ROBOT ATTACK

In this arcade-style game, ferocious attack robots converge on you --
the hapless player, who appears as a red-colored human on the screen.
The robots outnumber you by ten to one and if they touch you, you are
dead.  You have no weapons with which to defend yourself and so your
only alternative is to take advantage of the robots' one weak point --
they are extremely stupid and thus move straight towards you no matter
where you are.  Since they are destroyed if they run into each other
or into one of the electrified blockades (shown as blue boxes on the
screen) they themselves are destroyed.  The trick is to keep dodging
the robots and position yourself so as to cause them to collide either
with themselves or with the obstacles.  Either way they die, although
the visual effects are different for each case.  Remember not to let
them get too close, though, because they are attracted to you as
though you were a magnet and thus follow you no matter where you move.

The player moves the human around the screen by means of the eight
keys located in a circle around the D key.  They are: W, E, R, S, F,
X, C, and V.  Pretend that the human is standing on the D key. In
order to move in any direction, press the key in the corresponding
direction.  You may take your time about placing your fingers on the
required keys because no action is possible until all the ten robots
are distributed on the screen.
