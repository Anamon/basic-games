ARITHMETIC QUIZ

You can relax a little on this quiz because the questions are not
timed at all.  It is a test of your arithmetic ability, one in which
your skills of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are
challenged.  The quiz is devised so that all the correct answers are
integers.  Don't be fooled into thinking that for this reason there is
no real challenge, however.  It still isn't that easy to score well --
unless, of course, you cheat by using pencil and paper or a
calculator.
