Synonym

A synonym of a word is another word (in the English language) which
has the same, or very nearly the same, meaning.  This program tests
your knowledge of synonyms of a few common words.

The computer chooses a word and asks you for a synonym.  The computer
then tells you whether you're right or wrong.  If you can't think of a
synonym, type "HELP" which causes a synonym to be printed.

You may put in words of your choice in the data statements (510-600).
The number following DATA in Statement 500 is the total number of data
statements.  In each data statement, the first number is the number of
words in that statement.

Can you think of a way to make this into a more general kind of CAI
program for any subject?

Walt Koetke of Lexington High School, Massachusetts created this
program.
