Hurkle

Hurkle?  A Hurkle is a happy beast and lives in another galaxy on a
planet named Lirht that has three moons.  Hurle are favorite pets of
the Gwik, the dominant race of Lirht and... well, to find out more,
read "The Hurkle is a Happy Beast," a story in the book "A Way Home"
by Theodore Sturgeon.

In this program a shy hurkle is hiding on a 10 by 10 grid.  Homebase
is point 0,0 in the *Southwest* corner.  Your guess as to the
gridpoint where the hurkle is hiding should be a pair of whole
numbers, separated by a comma.  After each try, the computer will tell
you the approximate direction to go look for the Hurkle.  You get five
guesses to find him; you may change this number in Line 110, although
four guesses is actually enough.
