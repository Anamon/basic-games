Stars 

In this game, the computer selects a random number from 1 to 100 (or
any value you set in Statement 150).  You try to guess the number and
the computer gives you clues to tell you how close you're getting.
One star (*) means you're faraway from the number; seven stars
(*******) means you're really close.  You get 7 guesses.

On the surface this game is very similar to GUESS; however, the
guessing strategy is quite different.  See if you can come up with one
or more approaches to finding the mystery number.

Bob Albrecht of People's Computer Company created this game.
