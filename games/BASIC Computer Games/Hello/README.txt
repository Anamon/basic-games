Hello

This is a sample of one of a great number of conversational programs.
In a sense, it is like a CAI program except that its responses are
just good fun.  Whenever a computer is exhibited at a convention or
conference with people that have not used a computer before, the
conversational programs seem to get the first activity.

In this particular program, the computer dispenses advice on various
problems such as sex, health, money, or job.
