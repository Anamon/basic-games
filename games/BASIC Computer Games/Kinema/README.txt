Kinema

This program tests your fundamental knowledge of kinematics.  It
presents a simple problem: a ball is thrown straight up in the air at
some random velocity.  You then must answer three questions about the
flight of the ball:

  1. How high will it go?
  2. How long until it returns to earth?
  3. What will be its velocity after a random number of seconds?

The computer evaluates your performance; within 15% of the correct
answer is considered close enough.  After each run, the computer gives
you another problem until you interrupt it.

KINEMA was shortened from the original Huntington Computer Project
Program, KINERV, by Richard Pav of Patchogue High School, Patchogue,
New York.
