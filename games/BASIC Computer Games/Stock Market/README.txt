Stock Market 

This program "plays" the stock market.  You will be given $10,000 and
may buy or sell stocks. Stock prices and trends are generated
randomly; therefore, this model does not represent exactly what
happens on the exchange.  (Depending upon your point of view, you may
feel this is quite a good representation!)

Every trading day, a table of stocks, their prices, and number of
shares in your portfolio is printed.  Following this, the initials of
each stock are printed followed by a question mark.  You indicate your
transaction in number of shares -- a positive number to buy, negative
number to sell, or to do no trading.  A brokerage fee of 1% is charged
on all transactions (a bargain!).  Note: Even if the value of a stock
drops to zero, it may rebound again -- then again, it may not.

This program was created by D.  Pessel, L. Braun, and C. Losik of the
Huntington Computer Project at SUNY, Stony Brook, N.Y.
