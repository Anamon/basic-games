Hi-Lo

This game is an adaptation of the game gUESS; however, instead of just
guessing a number between 1 and 100, in this game you win dollars when
you guess the number.  The directions, in the words of the author of
the game, are as follows:

1. There is an amount of money, between one and one hundred dollars,
   in the "HI-LO" jackpot.

2. You will have six changes in which to guess the amount of money in
   the jackpot.

3. After each guess, the computer will tell whether the guess was too
   high or too low.

4. If the correct amount of money is not guessed after six chances,
   the computer will print the amount in the jackpot.

5. If the correct amount of money is guessed within the six chance
   limit, the computer will register this amount.

6. After each sequence of guesses, you have the choice of playing
   again or ending the program.  If a new game is played, a new amount
   of money will constitute the jackpot.

7. If you win more than once, then your earnings are totalled.
