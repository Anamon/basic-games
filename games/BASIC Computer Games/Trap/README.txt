Trap 

This is another in the family of "guess the mystery number" games.  In
TRAP the computer selects a random number between 1 and 100 (or other
limit set in statement 20).  Your object is to find the number. On
each guess, you enter 2 numbers trying to trap the mystery number
between your two trap numbers.  The computer will tell you if its
number is larger or smaller than your trap numbers or if you have
trapped the number.

To win the game, you must guess the mystery number by entering it as
the same value for both of your trap numbers.  You get 6 guesses (this
should be changed in statement 10 if you change the guessing limit in
statement 20).

After you have played GUESS, STARS, and TRAP, compare the guessing
strategy you have found best for each game.  Do you notice any
similarities?  What are the differences?  Can you write a new guessing
game with still another approach?

TRAP was suggested by a 10-year old when he was playing GUESS.  It was
originally programmed by Steve Ullman and extensively modified into
its final form by Bob Albrecht of People's Computer Co.
