Flip Flop

The object of this game is to change a row of ten X's

  X X X X X X X X X X

to a row of ten O's:

  O O O O O O O O O O

by typing in a number corresponding to the position of an "X" in the
line.  On some numbers one position will change while on other
numbers, two will change.  For example, inputting a 3 may reverse the
X and O in position 3, but it might possibly reverse some other
position too!  You ought to be able to change all 10 in 12 or fewer
moves.  Can you figure out a good winning strategy?

To reset the line to all X's (same game0, type 0 (zero).  To start a
new game at any point, type 11.

The original author of this game was Michael Kass of New Hyde Park,
New York.
