Depth Charge

In this program you are captain of the destroyer USS Computer.  An
enemy submarine has been causing trouble and your mission is to
destroy it.  You may select the size of the "cube" of water you wish
to search in.  The computer then determines how many depth charges you
get to destroy the submarine.

Each depth charge is exploded by you specifying a trio of numbers; the
first two are the surface coordinates (X,Y), the third is the depth.
After each depth charge, your sonar observer will tell you where the
explosion was relative to the submarine.
