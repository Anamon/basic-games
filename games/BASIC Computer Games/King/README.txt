King

This is one of the more comprehensive, difficult, and interesting land
and resource management games.  (If you've never played one of these
games, start with HAMMURABI.)

In this game, you are Premier of Setats Detinu, a small communist
island 30 by 70 miles long.  Your job is to decide upon the budget of
the country and distribute money to your countrymen from the communal
treasury.

The money system is Rallods; each person needs 100 Rallods per year to
survive.  Your country's income comes from farm produce and tourists
visiting your magnificent forests, hunting, fishing, etc.  Part of
your land is farm land but it also has an excellent mineral content
and may be sold to foreign industry for strip mining.  Industry import
and support their own workers.  Crops cost between 10 and 15 Rallods
per square mile to plant, cultivate, and harvest.  Your goal is to
complete an eight-year term of office without major mishap.  A word of
warning: it isn't easy!

student at Lexington High School.
