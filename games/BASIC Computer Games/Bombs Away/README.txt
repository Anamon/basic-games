Bombs Away

In this program, you fly a World War II bomber for one of the four
protagonists of the war.  You then pick your target or the type of
plane you are flying.  Depending on your flying experience and the
quality of the enemy defenders, you then may accomplish your mission,
get shot down, or make it back through enemy fire.  In any case, you
get a chance to fly again.

David Ahl modified the original program which was created by David
Sherman while a student at Curtis Jr. High School, Sudbury,
Massachusetts.
