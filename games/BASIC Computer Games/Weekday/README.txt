Weekday

This program gives facts about your date of birth (or some other day
of interest).  It is not prepared to give information on people born
before the use of the current type of calendar, i.e. year 1582.

You merely enter today's date in the form -- month, day, year and your
date of birth in the same form.  The computer then tells you the day
of the week of your birth date, your age, and how much time you have
spent sleeping, eating, working, and relaxing.

This program was adapted from a GE timesharing program by Tom Kloos at
the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.
