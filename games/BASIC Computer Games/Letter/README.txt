Letter

LETTER is similar to the game GUESS in which you guess a number chosen
by the computer; in this program, the computer picks a random letter
of the alphabet and you must guess which one it is using the clues
provided as you go along.  It should not take you more than five
guesses to get the mystery letter.

The program which appears here is loosely based on the original
written by Bob Albrecht of People's Computer Company.

[Note: The original referenced above is also in the collection.]
