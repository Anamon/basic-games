Diamond

This program fills an 8 1/2 x 11 piece of paper with diamonds (plotted
on a hard-copy terminal, of course).  The program ask for an odd
number to be input in the range 5 to 31.  The diamonds printed will be
this number of characters high and wide.  The number of diamonds
across the page will vary from 12 for 5-character wide diamonds to 1
for a diamond 31-characters wide.  You can change the content of the
pattern if you wish in Statement 6.

The program was written by David Ahl of Creative Computing.
