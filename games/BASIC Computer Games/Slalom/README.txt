Slalom

This game simulates a slalom run down a course with from one to 25
gates.  The user picks the number of gates and has some control over
his speed down the course.

If you're not a skier, here's your golden opportunity to try it with
minimal risk.  If you are a skier, here's something to do while your
leg is in a cast.
