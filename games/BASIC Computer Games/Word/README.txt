Word 

WORD is a combination of HANGMAN and BAGELS.  In this game, the player
must guess a word with clues as to letter position furnished by the
computer.  However, instead of guessing one letter at a time, in WORD
you guess an entire word (or group of 5 letters, such as ABODE).  The
computer will tell you if any letters that you have guessed are in the
mystery word and if any of them are in the correct position.  Armed
with these clues, you goon guessing until you get the word or, if you
can't get it, input a "?" and the computer will tell you the mystery
word.

You may change the words in Data Statements 512 and 513, but they must
be 5-letter words.
