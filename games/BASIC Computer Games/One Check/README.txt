One Check

In this game or puzzle, 48 checkers are placed on the two outside
spaces of a standard 64-square checkerboard as shown:

    * * * * * * * *
    * * * * * * * *
    * *         * *
    * *         * *
    * *         * *
    * *         * *
    * * * * * * * *
    * * * * * * * *

The object is to remove as many checkers as possible by diagonal jumps
(as in standard checkers).

It is easy to remove 30 to 39 checkers, a challenge to remove 40 to
44, and a substantial feat to remove 45 to 47.

The program was created and written by David Ahl.
