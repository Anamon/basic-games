Pizza

In this game, you take orders for pizzas from people living in
Hyattsville.  Armed with a map of the city, you must then tell your
delivery boy the address where the pizza is to be delivered.  If the
pizza is delivered to the correct address, the customer phones you and
thanks you; if not, you must give the driver the correct address until
the pizza gets delivered.

Some interesting modifications suggest themselves for this program
such as pizzas getting cold after two incorrect delivery attempts or
taking three or more orders at a time and figuring the shortest
delivery route.  Send us your modifications!

This program seems to have surfaced originally at the University of
Georgia in Athens, Georgia.  The author is unknown.
