Salvo 

The rules are not explained by the program, so read carefully this
description by Larry Siegel, the program author.

SALVO is played on a 10 x 10 grid or board using an x, y coordinate
system.  The player has 4 ships: battleship (5 squares), cruiser (3
squares), and two destroyers (2 squares each).  The ships may be
placed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally and must not overlap.
The ships do not move during the game.

As long as any square of a battleship still survives, the player is
allowed three shots, for a cruiser 2 shots, and for each destroyer 1
shot.  Thus, at the beginning of the game the player has 3+2+1+1=7
shots.  The player enters all of his shots and the computer tells what
was hit.  A shot is entered by its grid coordinates, x,y.  The winner
is the one who sinks all of the opponent's ships.

Important note: Your ships and the computer's ships are located on 2
separate 10 x 10 boards.

Author of the program is Lawrence Siegel of Shaker Heights, Ohio.
