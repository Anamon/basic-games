Digits

The player writes down a set of 30 numbers (0, 1, or 2) at random
prior to playing the game.  The computer program, using pattern
recognition techniques, attempts to guess the next number in your
list.

The computer asks for 10 numbers at a time.  It always guesses first
and then examines the next number to see if it examines the next
number to see if it guessed correctly.  By pure luck (or chance or
probability) the computer ought to be right 10 times.  It is uncanny
how much better it generally does than that!

This program originated at Dartmouth; original author unknown.
