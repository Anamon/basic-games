23 Matches 

In the game of twenty-three matches, you start with 23 matches lying
on a table.  On each turn, you may take 1 , 2, or 3 matches.  You
alternate moves with the computer and the one who has to take the last
match loses.

The easiest way to devise a winning strategy is to start at the end of
the game.  Since you wish to leave the last match to your opponent,
you would like to have either 4, 3, or 2 on your last turn so you can
take away 3, 2, or 1 and leave 1.  Consequently, you would like to
leave your opponent with 5 on his next to last turn so, no matter what
his move, you are left with 4, 3, or 2.  Work this backwards to the
beginning and you'll find the game can effectively be won on the first
move.  Fortunately, the computer gives you the first move, so if you
play wisely, you can win.

After you've mastered 23 Matches, move on to BATNUM and then to NIM.
