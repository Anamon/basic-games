3-D Tic-Tac-Toe

3-D TIC-TAC-TOE is the game of tic-tac-toe in a 4x4x4 cube.  You must
get 4 markers in a row or diagonal along any 3-dimensional plane in
order to win.

Each move is indicated by a 3-digit number (digits not seperated by
commas), with each digit between 1 and 4 inclusive.  The digits
indicate the level, column, and row, respectively, of the move.  You
can win if you play correctly; although, it is considerably more
difficult than standard, two- dimensional 3x3 tic-tac-toe.

This version of 3-D TIC-TAC-TOE is from Dartmouth College.
