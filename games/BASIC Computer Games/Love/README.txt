Love

This program is designed to reproduce Robert Indiana's great art work
"Love" with a message of your choice up to 60 characters long.

Your message is input as A$ in Statement 60.  Statements 100-130
repeat the message A$ if it is less than 60 characters long and insert
it intoT$.  Statements 210-400 actually print the design.  The data
statements are an alternating count of the number of characters and
blanks which form the design.  These data give the correct proportions
for a standard 1 character per inch Teletype or line printer.  The
13.2 characters per inch of the Teletype Model 43 on which this was
printed cause some distortion.

The love program was created by David Ahl.
