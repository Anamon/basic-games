Horserace

This program simulates a one-mile horse race for three-year old
thoroughbreds.  Up to ten people may place bets on the race up to
$10,000 each.  However, you may only bet to win.  You place your bet
by inputting the number of the horse, a comma, and the amount of your
bet.  The computer then shows the position of the horses at seven
points around the track and at the finish.  Payoffs and winnings are
shown at the end.

The program was written by Laurie Chevalier while a student at South
Portland High School.
