Math Dice

The program presents pictorial drill on addition facts using printed
dice with no reading involved.  It is good for beginning addition,
since the answer can be derived from counting spots on the dice as
well as by memorizing math facts or awareness of number concepts.  It
is especially effective run on a CRT terminal.

It was originally written by Jim Gerrish, a teacher at the Bernice
A. Ray School in Hanover, New Hampshire.
