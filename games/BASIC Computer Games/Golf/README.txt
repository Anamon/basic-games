Golf

This is a single player golf game.  In other words it's you against
the golf-course (the computer).  The program asks for your handicap
(maximum of 30) and your area of difficulty.  You have a full bag of
29 clubs plus a putter.  On the course you have to contend with rough,
trees, on and off fairway, sand traps, and water hazards.  In
addition, you can hook, slice, go out of bounds, or hit too far.  On
putting, you determine the potency factor (or percent of swing).
Until you get the swing of the game (no pun intended), you'll probably
want to use a fairly high handicap.

Steve North of Creative Computing modified the original version of
this game, the author of which is unknown.
