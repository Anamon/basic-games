Queen

This game is based on the permissible moves of the chess queen --
i.e., along any vertical, horizontal, or diagonal.  In this game, the
queen can only move to the left, down, and diagonally down to the
left.

The object of the game is to place the queen (one only) in the lower
left-hand square (no. 158), by alternating moves between you and the
computer.  The one to place the queen there wins.

You go first and place the queen in any one of the squares on the top
row or the right-hand column.  That is your first move.  The computer
is beatable, but it takes some figuring.  See if you can devise a
winning strategy.
