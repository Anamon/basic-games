Train

TRAIN is a program which uses the computer to generate problems with
random initial conditions to teach about the time-speed-distance
relationship (distance = rate x time).  You then input your answer and
the computer verifies your response.

TRAIN is merely an example of a student-generated problem.  Maximum
fun (and benefit) comes more from writing programs like this as
opposed to solving the specific problem posed.  Exchange your program
with others -- you solve their problem and let them solve yours.

TRAIN was originally written in FOCAL by one student for use by others
in his class.  It was submitted to us by Walt Koetke, Lexington High
School, Lexington, Mass.
