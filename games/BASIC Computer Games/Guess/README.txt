Guess

In Program GUESS, the computer chooses a random integer between 0 and
any limit you set.  You must then try to guess the number the computer
has chosen using the clues provided by the computer.

You should be able to guess the number in one less than the number of
digits needed to represent the number in binary notation -- i.e., in
base 2.  This ought to give you a clue as to the optimum search
technique.

GUESS converted from the original program in FOCAL which appeared in
the book "Computers in the Classroom" by Walt Koetke of Lexington High
School, Lexington, Massachusetts.
