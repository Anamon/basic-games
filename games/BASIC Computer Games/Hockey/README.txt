Hockey

This is a simulation of a ice hockey game.  The computer, in this
case, moderates and referees the play between two human opponents.  Of
course, one person could play both sides.

The program asks for team names, player names, and even the name of
the referee.  Four types of shot are permitted and a shot may be aimed
at one of four areas.  You are also asked about passing.  The game is
very comprehensive with lots of action, face offs, blocks, passes, 4
on 2 situations, and so on.  Unfortunately there are no penalties.
