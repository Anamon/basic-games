Poker

You and the computer are opponents in this game of draw poker.  At the
start of the game, each player is given $200.  The game ends when
either player runs out of money, although if you go broke the computer
will offer to buy your wristwatch or diamond tie tack.

The computer opens the betting before the draw; you open the betting
after the draw.  If you don't have a hand that's worth anything and
you want to fold, bet 0.  Prior to the draw, to check the draw, you
may bet .5.  Of course, if the computer has made a bet, you must match
it in order to draw or, if you have a good hand, you may raise the bet
at any time.
