LEM

This game in its many different versions and names (ROCKET, LUNAR,
LEM, and APOLLO) is by far and away the single most popular computer
game.  It exists in versions that start you anywhere from 500 feet to
200 miles above the moon, or other planets, too.  Some allow the
control of directional stabilization rockets and/or the retro rocket.
The three versions presented here represent the most popular of the
many variations.

[Note: See "Lunar" and 'Rocket" for other versions.]

In most versions of this game, the temptation is to slow up too soon
and then have no fuel left for the lower part of the journey.  This,
of course, is disasterous (as you will find out when you land your own
capsule)!

LEM was written by William Labaree II of Alexandria, Virginia.

This is the most comprehensive of the three versions and permits you
to control the time interval of firing, the thrust, and the attitude
angle.  It also allows you to work in the metric or English system of
measurement.  The instructions in the program dialog are very
complete, so you shouldn't have any trouble.
