Number

In contrast to other number guessing games where you keep guessing
until you get the random number selected by the computer (GUESS, TRAP,
STARS, etc.), in this game you get only one guess per play and you
gain or lose points depending upon how close your guess is to the
random number selected by the computer.  You occasionally get a
jackpot which will double your point count.  You win when you get 500
points.
