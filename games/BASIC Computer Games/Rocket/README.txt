Rocket

This game in its many different versions and names (ROCKET, LUNAR,
LEM, and APOLLO) is by far and away the single most popular computer
game.  It exists in versions that start you anywhere from 500 feet to
200 miles above the moon, or other planets, too.  Some allow the
control of directional stabilization rockets and/or the retro rocket.
The three versions presented here represent the most popular of the
many variations.

[Note: See "Lunar" and "LEM" for other versions.]

In most versions of this game, the temptation is to slow up too soon
and then have no fuel left for the lower part of the journey.  This,
of course, is disasterous (as you will find out when you land your own
capsule)!

Rocket was written by Eric Peters at DEC.

In this version, you start 500 feet above the lunar surface and
control the burn rate in 1-second bursts.  Each unit of fuel slows
your descent by 1 ft/sec.  The maximum thrust of your engine is 30
ft/sec/sec.
