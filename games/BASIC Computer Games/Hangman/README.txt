Hangman

This is a simulation of the word guessing game, Hangman.  The computer
picks a wortd, tells you how many letters in the word it has picked
and then you guess a letter in the word.  If you are right, the
computer tells you where that letter belongs; if your letter is wrong,
the computer starts to hang you.  You get ten guesses before you are
completely hanged:

    Head
    Body
    Right and Left Arms
    Right and Left Legs
    Right and Left Hands
    Right and Left Feet

You may add words in Data statements following Statement 508; however,
if you do, you must also change the random word selector in Statement
40.

David Ahl modified this program into its current form from one created
by Kenneth Aupperle of Melville, New York.
