Tic-Tac-Toe (Version 1)

The game of Tic-Tac-Toe hardly needs any introduction.  In this one,
you play versus the computer.  Moves are entered by number:

   1  2  3
   4  5  6
   7  8  9

If you make any bad moves, the computer will win; if the computer
makes a bad move, you can win; otherwise, the game ends in a tie.

A second version of the game is included which prints out the board
after each move.  This is ideally suited to a CRT terminal,
particularly if you modify it to not print out a new board after each
move, but rather use the cursor to make the move.

The first program was written by Tom Koos while a student researcher
at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry; it was extensively
modified by Steve North of Creative Computing.  The author of the
second game is Curt Flick of Akron, Ohio.
