Mugwump

Your objective in this game is to find the four Mugwumps hiding on
various squares of a 10 by 10 grid.  Homebase (lower left) is position
(0,0) and a guess is a pair of whole numbers (0 to 9), separated by
commas.  The first number is the number of units to the right of
homebase and the second number is the distance above homebase.

You get ten guesses to locate the four Mugwumps; after each guess, the
computer tells you how close you are to each Mugwump.  Playing the
game with the aid of graph paper and a compass should allow you to
find all the Mugwumps in six or seven moves using triangulation
similar to Loran radio navigation.

If you want to make the game somewhat more difficult, you can print
the distance to each Mugwump either rounded or truneated to the
nearest integer.  Statement 390 would print either INT (D + .5) or INT
(D).

This program was modified slightly by Bob Albrecht of People's
Computer Company.  It was originally written by students of Bud
Valenti of Project SOLO in Pittsburgh, Penhsylvania.

[Note: The original PCC version of Mugwump is also in the collection.]
