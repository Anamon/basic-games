The letters A-X and an empty square are displayed in a five-by-five
grid.  The object is to put these 24 letters in alphabetical order,
reading left to right in descending rows.  Press the four arrow keys
to maneuver letters.  A legal move is one that slides a letter in the
direction indicated by the arrow key trapped, filling the empty space
in that direction.  At the start, a player can choose from 10 to 1,000
displacement moves, and the starting position is already disordered.
The program recognizes the winning position.
