QUESTIGIAN TORTURE

An 8 by 8 grid (Extended Color Basic) is drawn.  One cell is blue and
is the starting point.  Another is orange and is the ending point.
All others are white.  Use arrow keys to travel to all white cells,
which turn blue as you go, and enter the orange cell last.  Once each
game you may make a diagonal move.  To enter diagonal mode, you must
not be in any row along the edge of the grid.  Then tap D for
diagonal.  A green text screen will appear with instructions on how to
move by typing two-letter codes (NE for northwest, etc.).  From this
mode, the grid may be briefly seen by tapping the Enter key, and your
position will be marked in green.  A diagonal move must be made into a
white cell or there is no effect.  Beware of boxing yourself in, and
know this puzzle is always beatable.
