ALLEY OOPS!

Four connected alleys (Color Basic 4K) are drawn.  The three vertical
alleys have three numbers in each, and the horizontal alley has an
orange cursor that can be moved through the network by tapping arrow
keys.  You score points by covering a number with the orange cursor.
The first number covered counts one time its value, the second two
times its value, and the third three times.  Object: Get a score of
exactly 50.  At the end of a round you will be shown your total
briefly and the game will go to the start of another round.  If a
score of 50 is not attained in 1 rounds, the program ends.  A winning
total is acknowledged.
