CIRCLES AND DISCS

An orange circle (Extended Color Basic) is drawn.  Look closely
towards the extreme west of the circle and you will see a flashing
cursor; it may be moved by holding down any of the arrow keys.  Move
the cursor to any position desired and tap D for draw.  A smaller blue
circle will be drawn.  You may draw five blue circles in the attempt
to completely cover the orange circle.  After the fifth move the
program ends but keeps the result of your moves.  The program does not
recognize a winning effort, but the player will.
