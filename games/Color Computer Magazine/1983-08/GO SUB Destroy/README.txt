(From Color Computer Magazine, August 1983.)

  Submarines, depth charges and excitement abound in this 4K game.

Some months ago I saw a game called Sub Destroy in another computer
magazine.  It required 16K and Color Basic, and was a conversion from
a Model I game.  There were a number of things I didn't like about it,
and, I thought it could fit into 4K.  So, without further ado, here is
4K Sub Destroy.

There are three subs that move from left to right on your screen, and
your white ship.  You control your ship with the arrow keys to move
left and right, and with the down arrow to fire depth charges.  The
subs will shoot torpedos back at you, but they have bad aim.  If they
hit you three times, your ship sinks.

Simple?  Perhaps a reader can design a way to make the subs fire more
than one torpedo at a time or to do it when close to the ship while
still staying within 4K.  Until then, have fun.
