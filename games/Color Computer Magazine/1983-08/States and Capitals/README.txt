  Learning Games by David Stevens

This year I'm asking my third grade class to learn the United States
states and capitals, one group at a time.  I wrote this program so
that non-Extended Basic machines could use it as well.  I don't know
if it will fit on a 4K machine, as I don't have one to try it on.

When you run the States and Capitals quiz, the computer will randomly
put the capital of a state or a state name on the screen.  The user
has to match the given name with its complement.

The program checks each letter as it is entered, and provides
immediate feedback if you type an incorrect letter.

This program will provide you with clues if you are totally stumped
for the first half of the word.  Simply type any key; if it is wrong
the computer will ask whether you want a clue.  There is a score card
at the end to let you know how you did during the session.
