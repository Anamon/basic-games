FLAT CUBES

Picture four cubes with various colors on each face.  Now picture each
of those cubes presented with its six sides shown in vertical rows.
In this manner, the rows across show the front, bottom, top, back,
left and right faces of each of the four cubes.

The object is to maneuver the cubes so the top four rows across --
front, bottom, top and back -- each has four different colors in it.
Be aware that the moves you make simulate reality.  Revolving a cube
in any direction changes its faces logically.

Think of the four cubes as 1, 2, 3 and 4 reading across.  The movement
commands are L for left, R for right, U for up and D for down.  Thus,
the command 1U will turn the first cube upward one move.  The command
3L would turn the third cube leftward one move.

Enter move commands when you see the prompt: DECISION?  Illegal move
commands are not allowed.  The test then recognizes and acknowledges a
winning position.
