JUMP AWAY SOLITAIRE

Forty-eight orange checkers are drawn within a white square.  The
checker at top left seems to have double length, but by tapping N for
north, S for south, W for west and E for east, the player will see the
checker is actually a cursor which can be moved to any of the 64
available positions on the board.  The object is to eliminate as many
checkers as possible, using regular diagonal checker moves.  To jump
and eliminate a checker, use these keys: left arrow key jumps
northwest, right arrow key jumps northeast.  The < key jumps
southwest, and the > key jumps southeast.  (The Questigians never
revealed a winning strategy, so you're on your own here.)
