"When, or should I say if, you complete the Color Stones, your next
test awaits you in the Yellow Room."  Bob pointed one of his crooked
fingers toward a door in the far corner of the room.  A yellow glow
seemed to ooze through the spaces between the door and its frame.

  The program draws 64 points in an eight by eight square.  Note that
  one point is red and is the starting position.  To its right is a
  yellow point, the ending position; the other 62 points are blue.  By
  tapping the four directional arrow keys, you will create a trail of
  red.  You must pass through all blue points and end your journey at
  the yellow point.  The object is to use straight lines, this is
  achieved by making as few turns as possible.

  Red Rover keeps its own score and prohibits illegal moves such as
  doubling back on or trying to cross the red line.  Also, you lose if
  you don't end your trip on the yellow point. -- Sorceror's note.
