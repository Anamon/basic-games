"Your final test for the night is Firecracker.  It is in the Red
Room."  Bob jerked a calloused thumb behind him.  Again a glow, red
this time, oozed through cracks and spaces in the walls and door.

"Failing this test might cost you a finger," Bob said smiling.  "The
Sorcerer doesn't like loud noises, so you won't hear a bang, but I
will."  Now the crooked man was laughing.  "Good night, young fools.
I must leave to feed the bats."

  The program draws a firecracker containing 20 random numbers ranging
  from one to nine.  There is also an orange cursor that can be moved
  to positions over any number by tapping the arrow keys.  To erase a
  given number, position the cursor over it and press E on the
  keyboard.  The object is to erase all 20 numbers without exploding
  the firecracker.

  You'll be successful when you figure out the systematic order in
  which the numbers must be erased to prevent an explosion.  It takes
  patience, but then it wouldn't be much of a puzzle otherwise. --

"You ready?" Sunflower asked Poke.

"No," said Poke.  "Let's get out of here."

"You go, I'm staying."

As Poke turned to leave Sunflower called after him, "Say hi to the
dragons for me."

Poke stopped and turned around.  He said, "I guess we'd better get to
work."

And they did.
