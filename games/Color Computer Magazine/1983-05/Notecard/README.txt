  Musical Flash Cards

  Throw away the dog-ears cardboard flashcards, power-up your
  computer, and learn musical notes by sight and sound.

  by R. F. Miller

Computers can turn an unpleasant lesson into an enjoyable game.  When
my 8-year old started piano lessons, his teacher gave him a pack of
flash cards with various notes on them.  We were to drill him with the
cards every day.  He didn't like it and neither did we.  I decided
this was a job for the Color Computer.

My program, Notecard, makes the drill fun.  Besides assisting in music
education, studying the program may give you some Extended Color Basic
programming techniques.

All the instructions appear on the screen, so just key in the program
and run it.  Notes are randomly selected between C below, and C above,
middle C.  It's easy to extend the range upward; taking it lower
requirexs a bit more effort.
