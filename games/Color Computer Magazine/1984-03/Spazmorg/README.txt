[NOTE: I believe that the code for this program is complete and
correct, but it does not run correctly on a disk-based Coco due to
changes in the memory map.  I've had no luck with getting a tape-based
configuration working, but I would gladly assist with any attempts or
image contributions.]

SPAZMORG

  by A. E. Bogdan

Spazmorg is the grand prize winner in The Basic category of The Summer
Programming Project.  It's a graphic real-time game and requires
logic.  It requires 16K Extended Basic, and won't operate with the
disk controller plugged into the computer.

The game has three versions, and uses the right joystick in play.  You
play against the clock and against the giant spider and the Spazmorg
that dwell in the castle in which you find yourself.  You are trying
to trap the baby Spazmorg -- the joystick fire button lets you open
doors as you pass from room to room in pursuit of the baby.  Complete
instructions and demonstrations are presented before the game, and
should be read and considered before playing.

Enter the program, save it to cassette, and run the game.  Menu
prompts guide the user through the directions and into play.

Good luck, and have fun!
