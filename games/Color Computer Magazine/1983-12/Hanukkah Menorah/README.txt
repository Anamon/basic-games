Color Computing for Kids

  Here's a lesson on low-resolution graphics, and two holiday
  programs!

  by Jean Plesser

December is a happy and festive month.  The holidays bring
celebrations, special decorations, surprises, and fun.  In keeping
with all this excitement, we're going to explore low resolution
graphics -- the first step in the graphics offered by Color Basic.

I hope your holidays are happy and bright.  My holiday greetings to
you are in the following programs -- there's one for Christmas and one
for Hanukkah -- each uses all the graphics routines you just learned.

[Note: See "Christmas Tree" for the other program.]
