MAGIC PUMPKIN

  Here's a Hallowe'en game to keep your ghosties and ghoulies busy!

  by George and Ellen Aftamonow

With all the witches, ghosts and goblins haunting the outdoors on
Halloween, it seems appropriate to invite a few in for an enchanted
brew and a game played on our Color Computer.  This is a computer
version of that old favorite, the African Hand Game, with a Halloween
twist.

When the moon is bright and the witching hour approaches, load this
program.  Remember -- not all things that go bump in the night get
along with one another.  In "Magic Pumpkin," a witch eats a pumpkin
and wins the round; a ghost scares a witch to death, to win the round;
and a magic pumpkin can exorcise a ghost, to win the round.  The
witch, ghost and pumpkin replace the traditional scissors, paper, and
rock.

Each character has an equal chance of winning.  The object of the game
is to outsmart the computer, which will randomly choose a ghost, witch
or pumpkin.  Once you have entered your selection, your choice and the
computer's random choice are graphically displayed.

The computer will also tell you who won the round, and keep score for
the user and computer.  The game will continue as long as you enter
choices.

Game instructions are simple and self-explanatory, displayed on the
screen before the game begins.  The game starts automatically.

Don't eat too many pumpkins!
