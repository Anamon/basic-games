(From Color Computer Magazine, March 1983.)

Have you ever run a program that drew curves or spirals and then
listed the program to see how it worked?  Were you then discouraged by
a confusing array of sines, cosines, and other trigonometric
functions?

If you can answer "yes" to the above, this article can relieve the
confusion by teaching you to graph polar coordinates.

All you'll need is a color Computer with Extended Color Basic, some
time to read the explanations, and a little patience to type in the
program.  I'm sure you'll find polar graphics quite easy.
