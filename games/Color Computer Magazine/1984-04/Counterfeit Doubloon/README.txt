THE COUNTERFEIT DOUBLOON

There are nine doubloons.  All are yellow, but only eight are truly
gold.  One is counterfeit.  The object is to determine which doubloon
is phoney through only two weighings of any coin on either side of the
scale, provided at the bottom of the screen.

There is a pointing orange cursor beneath the row of nine coins (which
are numbered).  Move the cursor left or right with the Arrow Keys.
When it is under a coin you want weighed, tap W.  The program will ask
which side?  Tap L for left or R for right, and the coin will be
placed on that side of the scale.

When you have placed all the coins you wish weighed, tap T for total,
and three things will happen.  A sound will be played and a flashing
orange square will appear on the side of the scale containing the
heaviest weight.  If the weights are the same on both sides, the
orange square will flash in the middle.  Then a record of the weighing
appears.  Example: You weigh coins 1-4 on the left and 5-9 on the
right.  The record of this will be as follows: 1) 1234-56789 R.  The
"1)" stands for first weighing, and the numbers of the coins on left
and right are separated by a dash.  Finally, the R at the end means
the coins on the right were heavier than those on the left.

After the second weighing, you will be asked to tell the number of the
counterfeit coin.  The coins may be rearranged each time you play.
