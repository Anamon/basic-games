AHAH

There are two puzzles here.  The first presents a series of letters.
Some are above and others are below an orange line on the screen.  The
goal is to deter mine why this particular arrangement is logical.  The
answer cannot be stated in computer terms, so when you feel you are
ready for the next puzzle in this program, tap Enter.

The second puzzle, which is unrelated to the first, presents a list of
nine letters.  The player is asked to type in the tenth, unstated
letter, which continues the series.  The program knows if the answer
is right or wrong; yet, the player will not find the answer anywhere
in the Program Listing.
