ALPHASWITCH

In 17 moves, put the letters A-X in alphabetical order, with the rows
of letters reading left to right like the words on a page.  Letters
are correctly ordered by exchanges.  Tap the Arrow Keys to take the
flashing cursor to a letter you want to move.  Tap E, then move the
cursor to a second letter.  Tap E again, and with this tap the two
letters will be exchanged.  (This puzzle is designed especially for
younger players.)
