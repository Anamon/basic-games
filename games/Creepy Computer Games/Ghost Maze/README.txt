GHOST MAZE

It's a creepy sort of place.  The identical dark corridors don't seem
to go anywhere.  It might even be haunted.  You can only see straight
in front of you, and you can only move in the direction in which you
are facing.  Yon can turn left or right, but this won't actually move
you anywhere, it will just show you another view.  All you have to do
is find the cross which marks the way out.  Your position is marked
with a Y and walls are marked #.

Gulp! It is haunted.  Ghouls are shown by a letter G.  If you get
right up next to one you will be whisked away to another part of the
maze, not knowing where you are or in which direction you are facing.
Here are the keys you can use: X moves you forward.  N turns you to
the left (through 90 degrees), M turns you to the right (through 90
degrees).
