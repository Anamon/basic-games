NUMBER WIZARD

This is the game the Number Wizard plays with all his visitors.  He
conjures the numbers 1 to 9 in the air and then rolls two dice.  You
must give him two numbers which both appear in the air and, when added
together, give the same total as the two numbers on the dice.  Once
you have used a number, its image disappears from the air and you
cannot use it again.  You win if all the numbers have disappeared
before all your turns are used up.  (You get an extra turn for every
double the Wizard throws.)  You are allowed to use zero as many times
as you like as one of your numbers.  If you can't go, move on to the
next turn by using two zeros.  See how many times you can beat the
Wizard.
