SPIDERWOMAN

Eek!  It's Spiderwoman! 

Ton might be lucky, she's in a good mood today.  If you can guess the
letter she is thinking of, quickly enough, she will set you free.  If
not, you'll probably get turned into a fly.

To find the letter, give Spiderwoman a word and she will tell you
whether or not her letter is in it.
