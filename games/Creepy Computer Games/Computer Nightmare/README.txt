COMPUTER NIGHTMARE

You are a late-night computer addict and you've fallen asleep at the
keyboard.  Suddenly your computer comes alive and starts hurling
numbers and abuse at you.  To beat it you have to match the numbers as
they appear on the screen.  Your starting score of 300 is increased if
you hit the right number and decreased if you don't.  If you can get
your score up to 500 the computer will give up and you win, but if it
goes down to zero, you will become a slave to your computer.  It's a
real nightmare!  Can you stay sane?

Based on an idea by Brendon Kavanagh.
