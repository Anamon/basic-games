GRAVEDIGGER

It's dark and windy -- not the kind of night to be lost in a
graveyard, but that's where you are.  You have until midnight to find
your way out.  Skeletons lurk in the shadows waiting to scare you to
death should you come too close.  You can dig holes to help keep them
away but digging is tiring work and you cannot manage more than five
in one game.  You have to be careful not to fall down the holes you
have dug too.

Grave stones (marked +) and the walls of the graveyard (marked :)
block your way.  The holes you dig are marked 0, you are * and the
skeletons are X.  See if you can escape.
