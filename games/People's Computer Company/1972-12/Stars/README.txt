STARS

STARS is a number guessing game.  We wrote STARS for small people, but
big people like it too.

STARS was written for EduSystem 20.  To run it on an HP 2000, delete
line 130.

* Play it for fun.

* Play it many times -- figure out what the stars mean.

* Develop a strategy so that you can always guess the number in at
  most 7 guesses.

??? Is there a strategy that will guarantee always guessing the number
    in at most 6 guesses?
