Reading Your Sunsign Design

*'s indicate expanding stuff.
O's indicate contracting stuff.
Space indicates no stuff.

The outer part of the design is your IMAGE (how you look to other
people).

The inner part is your BEING (how you look to yourself).

As you see, Bob Dylan's image is made of densely expanding stuff (lots
of ***).  Abraham's is more balanced (both * and O).

One's situation lies in the arrangement of his expanding stuff,
contracting stuff, and space.
