NUMBER

But what are random numbers used for?  Here is one example... a
program to play a number guessing game, human vs. computer.  The
computer generates a random whole number between 1 and 100.  The human
tries to guess the number.

I played the game.  Examine the results and discover my strategy.
There are better strategies... can you invent one?
