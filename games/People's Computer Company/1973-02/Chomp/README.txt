GOT THE MUNCHIES?  HAVE A BYTE...

But watch out for that last one!!

The game of CHOMP was introduced in Martin Gardner's Mathematical
Games Department of Scientific American for January, 1973.  It was
invented by David Gale at UC Berkeley.

This version is our first pass.  We changed the rules somewhat from
the published version.  Not only that, but this version doesn't play
the game at all -- it just keeps track of the moves and informs the
loser (who already knows he lost, anyway).

We'd like very much for you to send us any BASIC implementation of
CHOMP, any comments, etc.  We'll probably have a smarter version up
and running pretty soon.  Scientific American has described some
winning strategies for boards of given sizes.  In our version the
players INPUT the dimensions -- makes it harder to figure out the
trivial wins.

The rest of the way our program works should be clear from the
directions.  We're still finding out how kids solve the puzzle of
deciphering printed rules to games (this is a game in itself
sometimes).  The program runs on HP 2000 series, and on 8K PDP8/L with
Edu 20.55.
