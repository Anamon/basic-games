MISTRESS OF XENOPHOBIA

We'll start our exploration of simulations with the silliest one of
the lot, MISTRESS OF XENOPHOBIA, which is based on a program written
by Alastair Gourlay, a talented programmer who lives in Glasgow.

There's no need to explain MISTRESS, as the program gives you all the
prompts you could need.
