FASTERMIND

We'll start with something fairly simple -- FASTERMIND. You are
probably already familiar with this kind of game, in which you have to
try and crack a code developed by another player.

In this program, the computer thinks of a four-digit code (using the
numbers 1 to 9, and making sure that no digit is repeated within the
code) and you have to try and work out what it is within eight goes.

Each guess will get feedback in terms of "blacks" and "whites," where
a black is your reward for getting a correct digit in the correct
position, and a white is awarded if you have a digit right, but it is
not in the right position within the code.

[Note: These instructions are incorrect.  Digits can, in fact, be
repeated in the computer's code.]
