MUMBLE MARBLE

Our next brain game is a computer version of the game you may know as
"solitaire," in which you have to move marbles around a board.  At the
start of the game only the center hole is empty.  You can jump over
marbles into empty holes, and you remove the marble so jumped over.
The idea of the game is to end up with just one marble in the center
hole.

Many stories have been told about the origin of this game.  The most
interesting of these tales is the one that says the idea of the game
was worked out by a prisoner in solitary confinement in the Bastille,
who devised it as a way to relieve the monotony of his imprisonment.
Whether that story is true or not, there is no doubt that the game can
become quite addictive, as you try to devise a foolproof way to solve
it.
