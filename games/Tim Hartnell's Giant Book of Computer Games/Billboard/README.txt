BILLBOARD

BILLBOARD, as you can see from the following sample run, takes a
message of any length (up to the maximum string length permitted by
your system) and turns it into a printed message down the side of your
printer paper.  The printed letters can then be used to decorate your
walls, cut up to form posters, or used however your imagination
dictates.
