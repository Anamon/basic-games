ROBOT MINEFIELD

Time now to face the terrors, the dangers, and the horrors of the
ROBOT MINEFIELD.  There you are, peacefully tripping along one day in
the sun, when suddenly you find yourself trapped in a walled area,
with a number of manic robots, all bent on your destruction.

The robots are shown on the display as dollar signs, the H is you, and
the asterisks (*) are mines which are deadly to both you and robots.
Robots, pretty pretty clumsily programmed, can detect you, but they
cannot detect mines.  Therefore, your salvation lies in getting a mine
or two in between you and the robots, so that when they come toward
you they'll smash into mines and be wiped out.

The robots have one trick up their sleeves.  They can merge into one
another, so you may think only one robot is approaching you, when at
the last minute it splits into two or more, one going each way around
a mine.  This is not a game for those who seek the quiet life.

You can move north, south, east, or west (with north at the top of the
screen), and you enter the move you want to make by entering the
initial of the desired direction (so you enter "N" to go north, "S" to
go south and so on).
