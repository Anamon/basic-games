KNIGHTSBRIDGE

KNIGHTSBRIDGE is one of the few games which I can claim I invented
completely (although, of course, the idea of naming it after a London
suburb came from the two inventors of KENSINGTON).  I make habit of
reading games books to get ideas, and often when I walked in the woods
around London, I'd take a book with me to read when I felt like a
rest.  I was walking one Sunday afternoon near Ruislip Lido thinking
about a passage I'd just read in a book which said that chess evolved
from an Indian game in which the throw of a die dictated which piece
was to move.

From that starting point, I thought of a game in which all the pieces
were chess knights (hence the name of the game) and a die was used to
say which piece had to move.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE evolved from that idea.

It is played on a seven by seven board.  The computer tells you which
piece you must move (each piece is indicated by entering a two-digit
number, the first being the coordinates of the square you're moving to
down the side of the board, the second digit being the coordinates of
the square across the top), and then leaves you to decide where you
will move to.  All pieces move like chess knights, and all moves are
checked to see if they are legal before you are allowed to move.

You capture by landing on top of an enemy piece.  The first player to
capture five of the enemy's seven pieces is the winner.  There are no
multiple jumps.

You'll find the computer plays swiftly and well.
