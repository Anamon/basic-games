EXECUTIONER

As you can tell, this game is a computer variation of the old
pencil-and-paper game, "hangman."  In this game, the computer chooses
a word from its store (held in the DATA statements from 500 to 540)
and then challenges you to guess it.

The number of guesses you'll get is related to the length of the word
(see lines 120 and 170).
