LAS VEGAS HIGH

Finally, in this section of the book, we have a slot machine game, LAS
VEGAS HIGH.  You need only decide how much you'll bet before pulling
the handle on the machine (which you do by pressing the spacebar) and
the reels will whirl away.

Your winnings -- as you'd expect -- are related to the relative
difficulty of the various combinations coming up.  The computer keeps
up the chatter as the game, and your wealth (or poverty) unfold.
