CAVALCADE OF PUZZLES

There is no need to explain CAVALCADE OF PUZZLES.  The rules are all
within the program, which presents a series of fun activities and
games in a sequence.  As you'll discover when you play it, you have to
complete one game before you can move on to the next.

The listing is pretty long, but you can convince yourself it is
worthwhile by thinking of the peaceful time you'll have once it is in.
Whenever a well-meaning friend tells you how wonderful it is that you
have a personal computer, and then adds "but what can you do with it?"
all you need to do is load this program up, and then go and read a
book for an hour or so in peace, while the computer does the job of
entertaining.
