GOMOKU

You'll find GOMOKU an easy game to learn, but one which is almost
impossible to win.  The computer plays extremely well in this program,
which is based on one written by Graham Charlton.

You have to try to get five of your pieces (the H's) in a row in any
direction, while the computer is trying to do the same.

Have a look at these board positions from the start of one game I
played against the program.  Studying the printouts will show you how
the game unfolds, and will show you how to play it.
