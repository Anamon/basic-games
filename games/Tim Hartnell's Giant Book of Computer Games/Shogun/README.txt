SHOGUN

SHOGUN is based on the Japanese board game HASAMI SHOGI.  In this
game, generally played on the corner of a GO board, you move in any
direction (forward, backwards, or sideways) in a straight line.
Diagonal moves are not allowed.  As well, you can jump over a piece
(again in a straight line).  You can jump over your own pieces, or an
enemy piece.

The jumped piece is not removed from the board.  You capture a piece
by squeezing it between two of yours.  That is, you get one piece of
yours on either side (except along a diagonal) of a computer's piece,
and it is removed from the board.  A piece is not captured if it moves
between two of the opponent's pieces.

There are no double moves.  You do not get an extra move following a
capture.  In the original game, the aim is to remove all your
opponent's pieces from the board.  However, this is a fairly slow
game, and could take an eternity if played against the computer in
this way.  Therefore, I've written it so that the game is won by the
first player to capture six of the opponent's pieces.

You'll find that the game will more or less teach you how to play it
just by watching how it moves.  Don't forget the fact that you can
jump over your pieces, or the computer's pieces.  This is a
recommended tactic to get pieces well out into the board near the
beginning of the game to get the game moving.
