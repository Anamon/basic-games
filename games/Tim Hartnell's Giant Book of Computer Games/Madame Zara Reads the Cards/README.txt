MADAME ZARA READS THE CARDS

How convenient.  Not only do you save on "cross my palm with silver"
coins, but the output of this program is just about as believable as
the predictions laid on you by wandering fortune tellers.

Madama Zara has a totally unique deck of fortune-telling cards, The
Hartnell Arcana, which contains 36 cards.  The suits are Stars,
Stones, Shadows, Gems, Dust, and Echoes, and the individual cards are
Anchor, Tower, Elvling, Knave, Cleric, and Sovereign.  The four cards
which are selected, and their relationship to each other, determines
the fate Madama Zara reads for you.  (Actually, it doesn't happen like
that at all, as it all depends on your wayward random number
generator, but you don't need to tell your friends this.)

The program begins with a flashy display, then asks for your name and
birthdate, and tells you the astrological sign under which you were
born.
