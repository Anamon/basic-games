CUBIST

This is a two-dimensional version of the colored cube puzzle which
swept the world from Hungary.

The "cube" starts off looking like this:

    1 1 2 2
    1 1 2 2
    3 3 4 4
    3 3 4 4

After some manipulation by the computer, it will look something like
this:

    1 2 1 2
    3 3 3 2
    3 1 4 1
    4 2 4 4

Your job is to get it back into its original state in as few moves as
possible.  The numbers on the cube rotate in groups of four, spinning
in a clockwise direction. This means that:

    1 2
    3 4

when rotated will look like this:

    3 1
    4 2

You enter a number in order to rotate the elements of the cube.  The
key to move is as follows:

    2  3  4
    6  7  8
   10 11 12
