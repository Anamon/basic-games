CADDY

Now it's time for you and your versatile computer to tackle the
Microchip Golfcourse, with our next program, CADDY.

You have nine holes to negotiate, and as you'll see as you play the
game, the computer obligingly keeps the score card for you.  After
each hole it will tell you how you are doing to date, and will work
out your average score per hole.  All you have to do is hit the ball!
If you overshoot, the computer will automatically make sure the next
shot is back toward the hole.

You'll find it pretty tricky going, especially on holes with a high
difficulty factor.
