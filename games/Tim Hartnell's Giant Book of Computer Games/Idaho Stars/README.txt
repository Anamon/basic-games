IDAHO STARS

IDAHO STARS are stars with a special property-numbers placed on the
crossover points of the lines forming them will, when added together,
produce the same total, no matter which line of numbers is chosen.

Here, for example, is one such star:

                   31

            35   5    4   32

               1        3
                    2
             39          38

As you can see, each line on the star sums to the same total.  In this
program, the computer generates an IDAHO STAR, leaving two or three of
the numbers as zeroes for you to work out as quickly as you can.
