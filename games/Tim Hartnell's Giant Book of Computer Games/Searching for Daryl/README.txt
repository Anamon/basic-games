SEARCHING FOR DARYL

Finally, we have the most troubling program of all.  Daryl is lost in
an underground cave system of the most perplexing complexity.

You have to enter the system, and work your way to Daryl, who is in
cave 29, and then get out again.

The caves are connected by a stable, coherent set of tunnels, and you
should try and solve this puzzle by making a map as you work out how
the caves link up.  Be warned that some tunnels travel underneath
other ones.  The caves are not laid out in neat numerical order.
Rather, the cave numbers are provided just so you can refer to them
easily.

You may find the problem difficult, but it is by no means impossible.
The references within the program to directions (such as N for north
and so on) should be examined with care.  In fact, north is not up in
the case, nor is south down.  Rather, they refer to directions as if
the entire cave system was being viewed from above, and the direction
at the top of the system was the north, the east was the right hand
side and so on.  Anyway, the direction clues are more likely than not
to confuse you when you first try this program.

Don't give up easily.  It can be done.  The number of possible routes
is extraordinarily high, so once you've solved it one way, you may
like to work out another way of getting through the system.  Veterans
of the program like to get to Daryl by a new route each time they run
it, and then return to the entrance (carrying Daryl) by a completely
different route.
