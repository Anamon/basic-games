INNER SPRING

We'll start this section of the book with one of the simplest games of
the lot, INNER SPRING.  As the program explains, the computer produces
two numbers between one and 13, and asks you to bet on the probability
of the next number it thinks of lying between the first two.  It's
simple to play, and a lot of fun.
