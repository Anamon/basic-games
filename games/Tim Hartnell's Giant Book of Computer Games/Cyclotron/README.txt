CYCLOTRON

In CYCLOTRON, you fire atoms into the machine from the top, by
specifying a number, and you have to try and locate particles of
antimatter hidden within the machine from the behavior of the atom.

If the atom hits a particle of antimatter it will either be absorbed,
or deflected to the right or left.  An atom may be affected by more
than one particle of antimatter, which makes the resolution of the
problem even more difficult.

There are always three particles of antimatter in the machine,
although they could well all be in the same number cyclotron.  You
have an extremely limited number of goes in order to locate the
antimatter.  At each go, you can either enter the number where you
want to enter an atom, or be reckless and enter 8, which gives you a
chance to guess the location of the antimatter particles.
