TUTANKHAMEN'S TOMB

Tutankhamen was pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt, around 1360 B.C.
He became king at the age of 11.  The reason he is so well known today
is that his tomb, discovered by archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922,
is the only Egyptian royal tomb to have been found in almost its
original condition.  Most of the other tombs had long been ransacked
by thieves.

The Curse of the Royal Tomb hit those who dared disturb its sanctuary
after such a long time, and the Curse continues its evil work in our
program.  The game outlines the rules, and the background:

    YOU HAVE A LIMITED TIME IN WHICH
    TO FIND AN EXPLORER LOST WITHIN
    EGYPT'S GREATEST PYRAMID

    {}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}

    HE IS TRAPPED WITHIN THE PHARAOH'S
    TOMB...AND HAS ONLY A VERY SMALL AMOUNT
    OF AIR...YOU CAN TELL APPROXIMATELY
    WHERE HE IS BECAUSE HE IS KNOCKING ON
    ON THE SIDE OF THE TOMB AND YOU ARE
    MAKING YOUR WAY TOWARDS THE SOUND...
    YOU CAN HEAR KNOCKING....

    {}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}

    HOWEVER THE SOUND IS MUFFLED, AND
    YOU CANNOT ALWAYS TELL EXACTLY WHERE
    IT IS COMING FROM....

You play by entering one of the following letters, which indicate the
direction in which you wish to move as you continue your exploration:

    U - up
    D - down
    R - right
    L - left
    F - forward
    B - back
