CELESTIA

The first of the two programs in this section is CELESTIA, which you
can run either on your TV screen, or on the screen and to the printer
at the same time.  It produces an infinite series of evolving
patterns.

The patterns develop according to the rules of the famous computer
game of LIFE, developed by John Conway while at Gonville and Caius
College at Cambridge in the UK.  Martin Gardiner spread the game
throughout the world when he wrote about in Scientific American in
October, 1970.

In LIFE, cells are born, grow and die according to rules which Conway
invented.  Each cell on a grid (the colony of cells is imagined to be
evolving on a grid) is surrounded by eight others, and the state of
those eight other cells dictates what happens to the cell in question
in the following generation.

The rules which govern the evolution of the cells are as follows:

    * If a cell has two or three surrounding it, it survives to the
      next generation

    * If there are three, and just three, full cells next to an empty
      one, a cell will be "born" in that empty space in the next
      generation

    * Any cell with four of its neighboring cells occupied dies in the
      next generation

Don't worry, you don't have to know the rules, as the computer
interprets them quite happily by itself.  The rules produce patterns
which are far more attractive (and far less predictable) than you
could possibly imagine by reading the rules.  There is just one extra
twist in this program, which makes it even more effective.  CELESTIA
actually prints out four colonies each time a colony evolves.  The
original colony is in one quadrant of the screen, and the other three
quarters of the screen contain reflections of the original one.
