FLIPPER

This intriguing game can provide you with a considerable degree of
mental stretching.  When you run the game, you'll see a mix of X's and
*'s on a three by three grid.  You have to end up with an X in the
middle, and eight *'s surrounding it.

You enter the number of the place you want to hit with your flipper.
Flipping a corner piece causes those adjoining it to change into their
opposites (that is an X becomes an *, and an * becomes an X).  Hitting
the middle piece on a side with your flipper causes the two on either
side of it to change, and hitting the middle piece changes the middle
pieces on each of the sides.

The piece you hit always changes in each case.

[Note: This version corrects several logic errors present in the
original.]
