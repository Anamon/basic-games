NIMGRAB

NIMGRAB is a game which seems easy at first, but is the very devil to
play... and win.  You and the wily computer take turns taking objects
away from the screen.  There is a limit to how many you can take away
each move (and this limit changes from game to game, although it does
not change within a particular round of the game): The winner is the
person who manages to force the other player to remove the last
object.

Once you see it in action, you'll understand how to play it.  Then you
can start working on perfecting a method of actually beating the
computer.
