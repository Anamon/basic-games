AMANUENSIS

Next we'll have our poetry writing program.  This demands no
interaction from you, except for that of admiring the wonderful en
output of the program.  Here's a sample of the kind of verse it
produces:

    THE CONVOY CLAIMED SLAVISHLY
         IN THE COURT...
    PRAYING FOR AN ASTRAL INFLUENCE,
       TO DEMUR THE FAUN...
     EXHAUSTING, THEN GNAWING
        ...IMPOUNDING, BREAKING.
