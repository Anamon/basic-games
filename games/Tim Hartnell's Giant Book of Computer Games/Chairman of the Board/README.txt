CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD

Finally in this section we have our major simulation, CHAIRMAN OF THE
BOARD.

Again the program is largely self-prompting.  The aim of the game is
to keep your factory running until you manage to make $10,000 (in
total, combining the value of stock in hand plus your capital).  You
have to deal with recalcitrant unions (who won't always let you fire
the people you wish to get rid of, and have a great appetite for pay
raises which you cannot deny), with workers who will hardly ever meet
the production targets you set, and raw material suppliers who enjoy
putting their prices up as much as the unions enjoy slugging you for
more pay.

You'll find, in contrast to the other two programs, which are only
very vague approximations to "real life," that the life and health of
your factory will become very important to you, and you'll certainly
learn ways of manipulating resources for maximum return.  Keep in mind
that although you have great freedom in setting the retail price of
your products, each rise in price will increase consumer resistance to
purchasing those products.
