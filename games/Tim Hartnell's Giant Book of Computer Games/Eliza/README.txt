ELIZA

We'll start our investigation of artificial intelligence with a
simplified version of the classic program, ELIZA, which we discussed
at some length in the introduction.  As we said there, the program
scans your input for words it can use, and then reflects your words
back to you in a way which makes it seem as if the program is really
speaking to you.  Once you've played with it a while, you'll learn how
to trigger the most effective responses.
