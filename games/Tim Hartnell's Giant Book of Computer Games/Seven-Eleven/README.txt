SEVEN/ELEVEN

SEVEN/ELEVEN is another fine dice game, and one in which your goal
changes in each game.  Based on craps, you have a "target number" to
reach in each round (known as your "point" in craps).

Craps is an American version of the old English dice game "hazard."
In SEVEN/ELEVEN, the complex betting of craps has been removed,
leaving just the fun of the game.  Rather than worry about computing
odds and placing "pass" and "don't pass" bets, you can concentrate on
the serious business of praying for the right roll to come up.

In this game, you are playing against yourself.  Your winning and
losing rounds are tallied, so you know at every point in the game just
how well (or otherwise) you are doing.

You throw two dice at a time.  If you throw a 2, 3, or a 12 with your
first roll, you lose that round.  Getting a 7, or an 11, on the first
roll is the best thing you can do, because you've won that round with
that single roll (which is why the game is called SEVEN/ELEVEN).

Any other number rolled as your first roll of a round becomes your
"target number."  You have to try and roll this again, before you roll
a 7 or an 11.  If you manage to roll your target number again, you win
that round.  However, rolling a 7 or an 11 before you've rethrown your
target total causes you to lose that round.
