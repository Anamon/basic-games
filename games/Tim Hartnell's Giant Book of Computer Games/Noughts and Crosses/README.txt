NOUGHTS AND CROSSES

I'm sure that NOUGHTS AND CROSSES (Tic-Tac-Toe) needs no introduction.
Here is a program which plays fairly well, but not in a totally
predictable manner, so you stand a fair chance of winning a few games.

This may not sound like a big deal.  However, many NOUGHTS AND CROSSES
programs have been written so that a draw is the best you can do, if
you are not actually beaten by the machine.

This program decides who will go first in each game, and responds
swiftly to your moves.  You move just by entering the number of the
square into which you want to move.
