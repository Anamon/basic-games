MOONLANDER

There are two versions of our MOONLANDER program.  I suggest you start
off with the simpler of the two -- just called MOONLANDER -- and when
you're confident you can land on the moon successfully two times out
of three, you can graduate to REALTIME LANDER, which uses INKEY$ to
strobe the keyboard, and demands quick thinking to save your craft
from disaster.

The scenario of these programs is pretty familiar.  You are landing on
the moon, with limited fuel, and for some reason your onboard computer
is incapable of doing anything except reporting the state of the
flight to you.  The information you get is, of necessity, limited but
adequate.

You are told, at all times, your height above the moon's surface, how
much fuel you have left, and the speed with which you are descending.
You have to enter the correct amount of thrust to ensure you land
gently on the surface.  The fuel you have is limited, so you must
ration it to ensure you have enough left in the last few seconds of
flight to cushion your impact.  A "high-score" feature (lines 370 and
380) ensures you and your friends return to this program time and time
again in an effort to get a better "galactic rating" and to create a
less deep crater.
