RURAL PURSUITS

If you've survived being MISTRESS OF XENOPHOBIA, you may be interested
in something a little more earthy-running a farm. In RURAL PURSUITS,
based loosely on a program written by Stephen Glen, also of Glasgow,
you have a very difficult task, as you battle with an extremely touchy
work-crew to bring home the bacon (or at least the wheat and barley).

Again the program is largely self-prompting, and working with it will
teach you the best strategy for gaining a maximum return from your
farm (and surviving for the requisite 20 years to win the game).
However, a few hints will not go astray.  Although you can save money
by paying your workers extremely badly, you'll find they'll desert you
in droves in the following year, and the return you get from your land
is dictated, to some degree, by the number of people you have working
on the land.

Another factor to keep in mind is that the three crops which you can
plant have quite different returns, so it is in your interest to work
out which is the most profitable crop, and concentrate on that.

Do not be dismayed if you foul the process up the first few times you
run the program. You'll have to develop some real skills to keep your
farm solvent, and it may take you several bad years to get the hang of
it.
