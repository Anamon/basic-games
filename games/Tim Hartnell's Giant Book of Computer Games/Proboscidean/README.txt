PROBOSCIDEAN

PROBOSCIDEAN is a program in which the computer shows what a wonderful
memory it has, as it challenges you to a round of the card game
"concentration."

A deck of cards is shuffled, and then laid out on the screen.  You and
the computer take it in turns to choose two cards.  These are turned
over, and if they are a pair, the player who selected them is awarded
a point.  This process continues until all the cards have been
selected.  The winner, naturally enough, is the player who has
selected the most pairs.
