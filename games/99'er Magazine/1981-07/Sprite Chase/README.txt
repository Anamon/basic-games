SPRITE CHASE

  by Ron Binkowski

Wait... Wait... Wait...  When will they get here?
Wait... Wait... Wait...

"Hi dear, anything in the mail today?  Did you look between the doors?
Oh.  Shucks."

"Hello Ginny.  What?  You accepted a package from UPS for me?  Great!
Could you get it for me?  Thanks."

"See you later dear, I'll be downstairs."

They're here...

The SPRITES are here...

NOW, WHAT CAN I DO WITH THEM?

Skim through the manual, page 25.  Uh huh.  OK.  Yea.  This looks
great!  Let's get a little deeper.  Page 64. Oh oh.  COINC looks like
the ALL option doesn't tell you which SPRITES coincidenced."  I hope
someone can find out where to PEEK for this.

Now, what shall I do with them?  Something simple.  Design some cute
characters?  No, let's just get those SPRITES moving.  Since COINC ALL
might take some time to figure out which SPRITES are coincidental,
I'll stick to one SPRITE versus another.  How about a series to chase?
Numbers... Letters... ROTATION... That's it...

A short game chasing the 10 numbers or a longer game chasing the 26
letters.  I'll try the MAGNIFY too.  I'll need a numeric variable for
the COINC tolerance for that.  1 guess 8 for normal size and 16 for
double size.  I'll generate the number or letter SPRITES to go any
which way at some speed between -25 and 25.  I'll stick to the 8
directions around the arrows for the chaser or else I'll get so
tangled up in the math that I'll never move a SPRITE.  Wish I had
Joysticks.  I guess some kind of clock would be good for scoring.
