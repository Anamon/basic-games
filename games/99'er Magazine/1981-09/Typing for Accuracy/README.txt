TYPING FOR ACCURACY

  by C. Regena

Typing for Accuracy provides a student with practice in typing words
after he or she has learned the basic keyboard layout.  The words used
in the drill are in categories depending on where the keys are located
on the keyboard.

Seven finger-placement categories using different typewriter keys are
offered: home keys; home row; top row, middle finger; top row, pointer
finger; ring finger; little finger; and bottom row.  A typist may
choose one of the categories for each drill.

The program uses graphics and sound effects to liven up the drill: A
rocket appears on the screen and a word is printed on the rocket while
a 1.5-second tone sounds.  A student then types and enters the
word. If it has been typed incorrectly, the rocket blasts; if it has
been typed correctly, a second tone is sounded and the score is
incremented.  The rocket then moves upward (with gases trailing
behind) and a different word appears.

At the end of ten words the studentâ€™s score is tabulated and displayed
as a percent accuracy rating.  The student may then choose from the
seven drills or may exit the program.

This drill is not meant to be a speed drill since beginning typing
students need to gain accuracy and familiarity with the keyboard
before working on speed.  However, if the student wants a time test,
an approximate words-per-minute rate can be estimated using the tones
-- i.e., if words are entered as the tone ends, the rate is 40 wpm.
